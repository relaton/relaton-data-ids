  content: "   Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by and/or can\n
    \  be described by URI Templates.  RFC 6570 says that \"a URI Template is\n   a
    compact sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform\n   Resource
    Identifiers through variable expansion.\"  This specification\n   defines Template
    Descriptions, a schema and a media type that can be\n   used to document and describe
    a URI Template by supporting\n   descriptive markup that allows variables to be
    associated with\n   documentation (human-oriented) and/or descriptions (machine-\n
    \  oriented).  Template Descriptions can be used by media types (by\n   inclusion
    or by reference) that seek to make URI Templates self-\n   describing, without
    having to create their own representation.\n\t "

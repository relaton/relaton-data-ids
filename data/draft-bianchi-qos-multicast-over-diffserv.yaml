  content: "Efficient delivery of real-time multicast traffic imposes on the \nunderlying
    network infrastructure the burden of supporting Quality of \nService (QoS). This
    can be quite a complex issue in a Differentiated \nServices (DiffServ) IP network,
    especially if multicast users are \nallowed to dynamically join and leave the
    multicast tree. In fact, since \nDiffServ lacks of explicit reservation states,
    i) a replicating node \ncannot test whether a corresponding reservation exists
    on an output \nlink, and ii) upon a dynamic join of a QoS multicast user, the
    DiffServ \nnetwork lacks of control functions to verify whether resources are
    \navailable along the new path. In this document, we present a solution to \nsupport
    dynamic multicast with QoS over a DiffServ network. Our solution \ncombines two
    ideas. First, resource availability along a new QoS path is \nverified via a probe-based
    approach. Second, QoS is maintained by \nmarking replicated packets with a special
    DSCP value, before forwarding \nthem on the QoS path. We are fully aware that
    the possible application \nof the principles described in this draft in the Internet
    raises many \nissues, which we do not address. Our aim, then, is not proposing
    a \nfully-fledged solution, but contributing to the on-going discussions in \nthe
    international arena on these matters, by means of what we may see \nalso as a
    problem statement document. \n\t "

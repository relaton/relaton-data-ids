  content: "   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer model describes
    a\n   mechanism that allows two entities to negotiate a multimedia session.\n
    \  The SDP syntax of the Offer/Answer model uses constructs known as\n   media
    (m=) lines to describe each medium.  In SDP itself these \"m=\"\n   lines were
    designed to describe RTP sessions with any number of\n   streams (SSRCs).  Yet,
    Offer/Answer implementations in SIP\n   applications have most often used them
    as an envelope for a maximum\n   of two RTP streams (SSRCs) at a time: one in
    each direction.  The\n   most common reason for this has been the fact these applications\n
    \  could not meaningfully render multiple SSRCs simultaneously.\n\n   The above
    situation has led to difficulties once the need to\n   represent multiple (SSRCs)
    in an interoperable manner became more\n   common.\n\n   This document explores
    the use of \"m=\" lines for the negotiation of\n   sessions with multiple media
    sources, as per their original design in\n   SDP.  It presents the advantages
    of such an approach as well as the\n   challenges that it implies in terms of
    interoperability with already\n   deployed legacy devices.\n\n   The model described
    here was first presented in the RTCWEB No Plan\n   proposal.  The reason to spin
    it off into this new document is mainly\n   to separate the parts related to Offer/Answer
    and \"m=\" line\n   semantics, from those that are specific to WebRTC.\n\n\t "

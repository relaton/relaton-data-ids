  content: "   In a fat tree, it can be sometimes desirable to guide traffic to\n
    \  particular destinations or keep specific flows to certain paths.  In\n   RIFT,
    this traffic steering/engineering is done by using policy-\n   guided prefixes
    with their associated communities.  Routes based on\n   policy-guided prefixes
    are preferred over regular routes.  Any node\n   can originate a policy-guided
    prefix and advertise it in both north\n   and south directions, and the calculation
    in both directions are\n   distance vector based.\n\n\n\t "

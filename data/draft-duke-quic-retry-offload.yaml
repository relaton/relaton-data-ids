  content: "   QUIC uses Retry packets to reduce load on stressed servers, by\n   forcing
    the client to prove ownership of its address before the\n   server commits state.
    \ QUIC also has an anti-tampering mechanism to\n   prevent the unauthorized injection
    of Retry packets into a\n   connection.  However, a server operator may want to
    offload\n   production of Retry packets to an anti-Denial-of-Service agent or\n
    \  hardware accelerator.  \"Retry Offload\" is a mechanism for\n   coordination
    between a server and an external generator of Retry\n   packets that can succeed
    despite the anti-tampering mechanism.\n\n\t "

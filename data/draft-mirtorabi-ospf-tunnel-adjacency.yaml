- language: en

  content: "The OSPF specification requires that intra-area paths are always\n   preferred
    over inter-area paths, regardless of the path's cost. \n   In some situations
    this can lead to an inefficient usage of \n   network resources. This document
    describes a solution that helps \n   to address this problem by creating adjacencies
    through backbone \n   area that belong to non-backbone areas.\n\t "

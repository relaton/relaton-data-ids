  content: "To improve scalability of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
    it may be useful to aggregate Label Switched Paths (LSPs) by creating a hierarchy
    of such LSPs. A way to create such a hierarchy is by (a) a Label Switching Router
    (LSR) creating a Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP), (b) the LSR
    forming a forwarding adjacency (FA) out of that LSP (by advertising this LSP as
    a Traffic Engineering (TE) link into the same instance of ISIS/OSPF as the one
    that was used to create the LSP), (c) allowing other LSRs to use FAs for their
    path computation, and (d) nesting of LSPs originated by other LSRs into that LSP
    (by using the label stack construct).\n\n This document describes the mechanisms
    to accomplish this. [PROPOSED STANDARD]\n\t "

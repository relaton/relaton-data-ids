  content: "   This document presents the author's effort to understand the delays\n
    \  involved in publishing an idea in the IETF, from the first individual\n   draft
    to the publication of the RFC.  We analyze a set of randomly\n   chosen RFC approved
    in 2018, looking for history and delays.  We also\n   use two randomly chosen
    sets of RFC published in 2008 and 1998 for\n   comparing delays seen in 2018 to
    those observed 10 or 20 years ago.\n   The average RFC in the 2018 sample was
    produced in 3 years and 4\n   months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent
    in the working\n   group, 3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and
    3 to 4\n   months in RFC production.  The main variation in RFC production\n   delays
    comes from the AUTH-48 phase.\n\n   We also measure the number of citations of
    the chosen RFC using\n   Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what
    we know about\n   deployment.  We show that citation counts indicate academic
    interest,\n   but correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the\n   specifications.
    \ Counting web references could complement that.\n\n   The RFCs selected for this
    survey were chosen at random and represent\n   a small sample of all RFCs produced,
    and only approximately 10% of\n   the RFCs produced in each of 1998, 2008, and
    2018.  It is possible\n   that different samples would produce different results.
    \ Furthermore,\n   the conclusions drawn from the observations made in this document\n
    \  represent the author's opinions and do not have consensus of the\n   IETF.\n\n\t "

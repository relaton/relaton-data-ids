- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In a network running PIM-SM, multicast traffic can fail to be\n   properly
    routed and forwarded during some period of time after a\n   topology change, when
    unicast routing converges to a new path using a\n   new next-hop before multicast
    routing adjacencies are fully setup\n   with this new next-hop.  At this point,
    a blackhole appears in the\n   multicast topology and persists until the PIM adjacency
    become fully\n   setup.  This document describes different procedures aiming at\n
    \  avoiding such blackholes, focusing on the use of non-congruent\n   unicast
    routing that takes into account the status of PIM\n   adjacencies.\n\t "

  content: "   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications\n
    \  are designed to make identity management in cloud-based applications\n   and
    services easier.\n\n   This document provides a platform-neutral schema for representing
    AI\n   agents' identities in JSON format, enabling them to be transferred in\n
    \  the SCIM protocol to the service.  This establishes an agentic\n   identity
    so that an agent can subsequently be authenticated and\n   authorized to interact
    with the service.\n\n\t "

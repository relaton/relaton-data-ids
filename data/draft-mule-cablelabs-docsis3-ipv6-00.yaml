  content: "This document provides an overview of the draft requirements for IPv6\nsupport
    in the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications.  Our goal is to\nshare high-level
    IPv6 requirements and design architecture in draft\nstatus with the IETF community.\n\nWe
    first introduce the main network elements involved in the support\nof IPv6 in
    DOCSIS cable networks and expand on the deployment\nscenarios in scope of the
    DOCSIS 3.0 efforts.  We elaborate on the\nroles played by some network elements
    in enabling IPv6 in DOCSIS: the\nbroadband access device (Cable Modem), the headend
    or network side\nequipment (Cable Modem Termination System) and the various backoffice\nservers.
    \ Some high-level requirements are then summarized with a\nspecial focus on three
    network services: IPv6 provisioning and\nmanagement of cable modems, IPv6 transport
    via a DOCSIS network using\na cable modem acting as an IPv6 bridge or router,
    and IP multicast.\nFinally, we conclude with a theory of operations section to
    provide\nmore details and sample flows on how an IPv6-capable cable modem\nacquires
    its IPv6 address and configuration parameters over a DOCSIS\n3.0 network.\n\nCableLabs,
    its members, the vendors participating in the DOCSIS\nspecifications and the co-authors
    of this document are seeking\ngeneral feedback from the IETF community on the
    overall DOCSIS IPv6\napproach.  The level of requirements provided in this document
    may\nvary; we also welcome feedback on where more details should be\nprovided
    in future versions.\n\n\t "

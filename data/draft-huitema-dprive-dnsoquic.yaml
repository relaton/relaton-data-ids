  content: "   This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport privacy\n
    \  for DNS.  The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to\n   that
    provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-\n   line blocking
    issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient\n   error corrections than
    UDP.  DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy\n   properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT)
    specified in RFC7858, and\n   performance characteristics similar to classic DNS
    over UDP.\n\n\t "

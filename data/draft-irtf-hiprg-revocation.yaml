  content: "   This document mainly analyzes the key revocation issue with host\n
    \  identifiers (HIs) in the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  Generally,\n   key
    revocation is an important functionality of key management\n   systems; it is
    concerned with the issues of removing cryptographic\n   keys from operational
    use when they are not secure or not secure\n   enough any more.  This functionality
    is particularly important for\n   the security systems expected to execute for
    long periods.  This\n   document also attempts to investigate several issues that
    a designer\n   of HI revocation mechanisms need to carefully consider.\n\n\n\t "

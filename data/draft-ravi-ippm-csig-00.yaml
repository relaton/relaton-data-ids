  content: "   This document presents Congestion Signaling (CSIG), an in-band\n   network
    telemetry protocol that allows end-hosts to obtain visibility\n   into fine-grained
    network signals for congestion control, traffic\n   management, and network debuggability
    in the network.  CSIG provides\n   a simple, low-overhead, and extensible packet
    header mechanism to\n   obtain fixed-length summaries from bottleneck devices
    along a packet\n   path.  This summarized information is collected over L2 CSIG-tags
    in\n   a compare-and-replace manner across network devices along the path.\n   Receivers
    can reflect this information back to senders via L4+ CSIG\n   reflection headers.\n\n
    \  CSIG builds upon the successful aspects of prior work such as switch\n   in-band
    network telemetry (INT) that incorporates multibit signals in\n   live data packets.
    \ At the same time, CSIG's end-to-end mechanism for\n   carrying the signals via
    fixed size header is simple, practical and\n   deployable akin to Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN).\n\n   In addition to a detailed description of the end-to-end
    protocol,\n   this document also motivates the use cases for CSIG and the rationale\n
    \  for design choices made in CSIG.  It describes a set of signals of\n   interest
    to applications (minimum available bandwidth, maximum link\n   utilization, and
    maximum hop delay), methods to compute these signals\n   in network devices, and
    how these signals can be leveraged in\n   applications.  Additionally, it describes
    how attributes about the\n   bottleneck's location can be carried and made useful
    to applications.\n   It also provides the framework to incorporate future signals.\n
    \  Finally, this document addresses incremental deployment, backward\n   compatibility
    and nuances of CSIG's applicability in a range of\n   scenarios.\n\n\t "

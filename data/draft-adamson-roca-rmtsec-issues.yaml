  content: "\n   This document describes some security risks of the Reliable Multicast\n
    \  Transport (RMT) Working Group set of building blocks and protocols.\n   An
    emphasis is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of\n   transport
    protocol design.  However, relevant security issues related\n   to IP Multicast
    control-plane and other concerns not strictly within\n   the scope of reliable
    transport protocol design are also discussed.\n\n   The document also begins an
    exploration of approaches that could be\n   embraced to mitigate these risks.
    \ The purpose of this document is to\n   provide a consolidated security discussion
    and provide a basis for\n   further discussion and potential resolution of any
    significant\n   security issues that may exist in the current set of RMT standards.\n\n\n\t "

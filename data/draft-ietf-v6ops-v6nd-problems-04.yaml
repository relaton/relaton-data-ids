  script: Latn
  content: "   In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover\n
    \  the actual number of machines on the subnet.  In contrast, the\n   default
    IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers\n   trillions of addresses,
    the overwhelming number of which will be\n   unassigned.  Consequently, simplistic
    implementations of Neighbor\n   Discovery (ND) can be vulnerable to deliberate
    or accidental denial\n   of service, whereby they attempt to perform address resolution
    for\n   large numbers of unassigned addresses.  Such denial of attacks can be\n
    \  launched intentionally (by an attacker), or result from legitimate\n   operational
    tools or accident conditions.  As a result of these\n   vulnerabilities, new devices
    may not be able to \"join\" a network, it\n   may be impossible to establish new
    IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6\n   transported flows may be interrupted.\n\n   This
    document describes the potential for DOS in detail and suggests\n   possible implementation
    improvements as well as operational\n   mitigation techniques that can in some
    cases be used to protect\n   against or at least alleviate the impact of such
    attacks.\n\n\t "

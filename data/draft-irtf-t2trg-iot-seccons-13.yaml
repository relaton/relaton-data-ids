  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard\n
    \  Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing\n   communication.
    \ The security needs for IoT systems are well-\n   recognized and many standardization
    steps to provide security have\n   been taken, for example, the specification
    of Constrained Application\n   Protocol (CoAP) secured with Datagram Transport
    Layer Security\n   (DTLS).  However, security challenges still exist, not only
    because\n   there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution, but also\n
    \  because many IoT devices and systems have been designed and deployed\n   with
    very limited security capabilities.  In this document, we first\n   discuss the
    various stages in the lifecycle of a thing.  Next, we\n   document the security
    threats to a thing and the challenges that one\n   might face to protect against
    these threats.  Lastly, we discuss the\n   next steps needed to facilitate the
    deployment of secure IoT systems.\n   This document can be used by implementors
    and authors of IoT\n   specifications as a reference for details about security\n
    \  considerations while documenting their specific security challenges,\n   threat
    models, and mitigations.\n\n   This document is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing
    Research Group\n   (T2TRG).\n\n\t "

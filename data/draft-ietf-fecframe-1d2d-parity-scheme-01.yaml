  content: "This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error\nCorrection
    (FEC) that is generated by the non-interleaved and\ninterleaved parity codes from
    a source media encapsulated in RTP.\nThese parity codes are systematic codes,
    where a number of repair\nsymbols are generated from a set of source symbols and
    sent in a\nrepair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source\nsymbols.
    \ The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes offer a\ngood protection against
    random and bursty packet losses,\nrespectively, at a cost of decent complexity.
    \ The RTP payload\nformats that are defined in this document address the scalability\nissues
    experienced with the earlier specifications including RFC\n2733, RFC 5109 and
    SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several improvements.  Due\nto these changes, the new
    payload formats are not backward compatible\nwith the earlier specifications.\n\t "

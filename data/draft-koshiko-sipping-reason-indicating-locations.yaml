abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header to indicate the location of \n   the
    SIP element which issued a certain SIP message. This capability\n   enables many
    enhanced services by providing the information as to how\n   and why a SIP message
    arrives at a specific application, user, or\n   proxy server. This draft defines
    new reason-params for the protocol\n   field of the Reason header field in RFC3326
    [1].\n\t "

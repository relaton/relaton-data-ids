  script: Latn
  content: "NAT64 (Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4
    Servers) allows client devices using IPv6 to communicate with servers that have
    only IPv4 connectivity.\n\n The specification for how a client discovers its local
    network's NAT64 prefix (RFC 7050) defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for
    this purpose. However, in its Domain Name Reservation Considerations section (Section
    8.1), that specification (RFC 7050) indicates that the name actually has no particularly
    special properties that would require special handling.\n\n Consequently, despite
    the well-articulated special purpose of the name, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded
    in the Special-Use Domain Names registry as a name with special properties.\n\n
    This document updates RFC 7050. It describes the special treatment required and
    formally declares the special properties of the name. It also adds similar declarations
    for the corresponding reverse mapping names.\n\t "

  content: "   In large-scale deterministic networks (LDN), App-flows need to span\n
    \  multiple deterministic network domains, and the latency in multiple\n   domains
    is added together. The jitter will be increased. In order to\n   realize the protection
    service function, App-flows should be\n   transmitted on multiple paths. The delay
    difference in data\n   transmission on different paths is no different from jitter
    in end-\n   to-end services. Jitter generated by various factors needs to be\n
    \  reduced to meet business requirements.\n\n   This document describes the end-to-end
    jitter reduction mechanism in\n   an LDN. This mechanism can effectively control
    the end-to-end jitter\n   to meet specific business needs and make the planning
    of multiple\n   paths for service protection more flexible.\n\n\t "

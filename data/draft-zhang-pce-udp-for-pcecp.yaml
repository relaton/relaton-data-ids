  content: "The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol defines a \nrequest/response
    protocol used for the communication between a Path \nComputation Client (PCC)
    and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or \nbetween two PCEs. PCEP employs Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) as \nthe transport layer protocol by using a registered
    TCP port. \n\nThis document proposes the possibility of employing UDP as the \ntransport
    layer protocol instead of TCP. \n\nUDP is a connectionless protocol within TCP/IP
    protocol suite that \ncorresponds to the transport layer in the ISO/OSI reference
    model. \nUDP converts data messages generated by an application into packets \nto
    be sent through IP. The reliability is not guaranteed by UDP and \nshould be ensured
    by the application that generates the data message. \n\nThe PCECP application
    is flexible to ensure the reliability of PCECP \nmessages. This document explains
    on how the reliability of the PCECP \nmessages can be achieved by means of PCECP,
    while operating PCECP \nover UDP.\n\t "

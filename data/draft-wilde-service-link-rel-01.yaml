  content: "   Many resources provided on the Web are part of a sets of resources\n
    \  that are provided in a context that is defined and managed by one\n   particular
    service provider.  Often, these sets of resources are\n   referred to as \"Web
    Services\" or \"Web APIs\".  This specification\n   defines two link relations
    that allow to represent relationships from\n   those resources to ones that provide
    documentation or descriptions of\n   the Web services.  The difference between
    these concepts is that\n   documentation is primarily intended for human consumers,
    whereas\n   descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses the use of the 3GPP Generic Bootstrapping\n
    \  Architecture (GBA) for authenticating and securing constrained\n   devices.
    \ While GBA re-uses the 3GPP credentials, it does not require\n   mobile network
    access, such as LTE, but requires only IP\n   connectivity.  Though building devices
    that employ GBA is obviously\n   well known, this document specifically focuses
    on techniques\n   necessary to minimize memory and energy consumption which is\n
    \  essential for constrained device networks.\n\n\t "

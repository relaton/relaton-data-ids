  content: "Concast is a many-to-one best-effort network service that allows a\nreceiver
    to treat a group of senders as a single entity, in much the\nsame way that IP
    multicast allows a sender to treat a group of\nreceivers as one.  Each concast
    datagram delivered to a receiver is\nderived from (possibly many) datagrams sent
    by different members of\nthe concast group to that receiver, according to a 'merge\nspecification'.
    \ Concast allows the semantics of this merging\noperation to vary to suit the
    needs of different applications.  This\ndocument describes the concast service
    and presents a framework for\ndefining merge semantics.  It also describes the
    processing of\nconcast datagrams by concast-capable routers and hosts.  The concast\nsignaling
    protocol (CSP), an integral part of the concast service, is\nspecified in a separate
    document.\n\t "

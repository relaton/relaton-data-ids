  content: "Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning\nan
    Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's\nlocation.  These
    protocols lack a mechanism for the target host to\ninspect or set the privacy
    rules that are applied to the URIs they\ndistribute.  This document extends the
    current location configuration\nprotocols to provide hosts with a reference to
    the rules that are\napplied to a URI, so that the host can view or set these rules.\n\t "

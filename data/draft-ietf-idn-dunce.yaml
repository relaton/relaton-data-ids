  content: "This document describes a transformation method for representing\nnon-ASCII
    characters in host name parts in a fashion that is\ncompletely compatible with
    the current DNS. It is a potential\ncandidate for an ASCII-Compatible Encoding
    (ACE) for\ninternationalized host names, as described in the comparison\ndocument
    from the IETF IDN Working Group.  This method is based\nexclusively on long-established
    mechanisms for denoting the\npositions of characters in tables, but included variations
    for\ncompressing that information, also based on long-established\nmechanisms.\n\n\t "

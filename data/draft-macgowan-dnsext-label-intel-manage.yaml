  content: "A multidimensional array of domain label analysis and extensions are \noffered
    to overcome a number of issues with the DNS and its use to \nlocate resources
    on the Internet. These goals are accomplished by \nproposing a naming convention
    to add labels to domain strings. The \nresult will be a rational relationship
    to the content that will provide \na method for meeting the ever-increasing need
    to expand the namespace, \nwhile providing an efficient search system to access
    content in a user-\nfriendly manner.\n\t "

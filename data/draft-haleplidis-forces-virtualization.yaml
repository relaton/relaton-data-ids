  content: "   Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an\n   architectural
    framework and associated protocols to standardize\n   information exchange between
    the control plane and the forwarding\n   plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES
    NE).  RFC5812 has defined\n   the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent
    the capabilities,\n   state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the
    context of\n   the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control
    the\n   FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes the logical\n
    \  functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these\n   functions
    support, and how these functions are or can be\n   interconnected.\n\n   The ForCES
    model provides the necessary abstractions to natively\n   support virtualization
    of the forwarding plane.  This documents\n   describes a formal approach to model
    the necessary parameters\n   required for defining and managing virtual network
    forwarding planes\n   to create virtual network elements.\n\n\t "

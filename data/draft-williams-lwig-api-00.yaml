  content: "   This document takes a look at various aspects of Application\n   Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) used in embedded sensors and controller\n   applications such
    as IP Smart Objects and IP based Wireless Sensor\n   Networks.  These devices
    may be interconnected via many different\n   types of media, including 802.15.4
    (lowpans), power line control\n   (PLC), RS485, but the common characteristic
    is that the devices have\n   extremely limited code space and memory space for
    both the stack and\n   application.  Just as there is no one single API for IP
    networking\n   stacks today (though the \"Berkeley sockets\" might be considered
    de-\n   facto standard) there is not likely to be a single standard in the\n   embedded
    space, but there can be some common understanding about\n   facilities that can
    and should be provided to the application\n   developer.\n\n\t "

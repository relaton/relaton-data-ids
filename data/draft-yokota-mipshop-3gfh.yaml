  content: "Mobile IPv6 is designed to maintain its connectivity while moving\n   from
    one network to another.  It is adopted in 3G CDMA networks as a\n   way to maintain
    connectivity when the mobile node moves between\n   access provider networks.
    \ However, this handover procedure requires\n   not only movement detection, but
    also the acquisition of a new\n   care-of address and the sending of a binding
    update message to the\n   home agent before the traffic begins to direct to the
    new location.\n   During this period, packets destined for the mobile node will
    be\n   lost, which may not be acceptable for real-time application such as\n   Voice
    over IP (VoIP) or video telephony.  This document specifies\n   fast handover
    methods and selective bi-casting methods in the 3G\n   context in order to reduce
    latency and packet loss during handover.\n\t "

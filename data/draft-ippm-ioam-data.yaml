  content: "   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records\n
    \  operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet\n   traverses
    a path between two points in the network.  This document\n   discusses the data
    fields and associated data types for in-situ OAM.\n   In-situ OAM data fields
    can be embedded into a variety of transports\n   such as NSH, Segment Routing,
    Geneve, native IPv6 (via extension\n   header), or IPv4.  In-situ OAM can be used
    to complement OAM\n   mechanisms based on e.g.  ICMP or other types of probe packets.\n\n\t "

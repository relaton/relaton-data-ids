  content: "   This document is a companion document to \"SDP Offer/Answer for RTP\n
    \  using QUIC as Transport\".  That document focuses on the description\n   and
    registration of SDP \"proto\" attribute parameters with IANA, to\n   allow applications
    that rely on SDP Offer/Answer to negotiate the\n   QUIC protocol as an encapsulation
    for RTP.\n\n   In writing that document, it became obvious that decisions about
    an\n   appropriate SDP description would depend on decisions about the way\n   RTP
    would be encapsulated in QUIC, and different proposals for those\n   encapsulations
    had made different assumptions.  Given that none of\n   these proposals have been
    adopted by an IETF working group yet, it's\n   not appropriate to try to base
    a general-purpose set of \"QUIC/RTP\"\n   IANA registrations on any one of them,
    so this document includes the\n   questions that have come up, and (as discussions
    progress) suggested\n   answers for those questions.\n\n\t "

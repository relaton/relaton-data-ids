  content: "The aim of this document is to standardize remote access options to \nparameters
    of embedded devices with limited resources.  Typically \nsuch devices are based
    on 8-bit or 16-bit microcontrollers with \nlimited memory (64K or less) and a
    low operating frequency (20 MHz or \nless).  The protocol described in this document
    uses existing markup \nformats to specify modifiable parameters of embedded devices
    and \nexisting protocols to transfer these parameters between clients and \nservers.

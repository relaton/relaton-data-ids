abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has existing mechanisms for \n
    \  securing its signaling messages.  SIP has several transport \n   layers it
    works across: TCP, UDP, SCTP, and TLS over TCP.  There \n   currently is no mechanism
    to ensure that if TLS over TCP is chosen \n   by the originating UAC, the messaging
    will remain encrypted on a \n   hop-by-hop basis to the destination UAS.  This
    document discusses \n   this scenario, providing the requirements for such to
    exist, and \n   offering pieces of a possible solution for this set of requirements.\n\t "

  content: "   With the continuous growth of business volume, the transmission rate\n
    \  and number of network elements have increased sharply, and energy\n   consumption
    of transport network has increased accordingly.  Rising\n   power costs due to
    significant energy consumption in transport\n   networks necessitate energy-saving
    measures.  To address this,\n   adjusting energy consumption strategies according
    to different\n   service requirements to optimize efficiency, ensuring quality
    while\n   eliminating waste.  Furthermore, regular network optimization and\n
    \  energy efficiency assessments enhance equipment performance and\n   extend
    lifespan, thereby controlling long-term operational costs.\n   Integrating energy-saving
    concepts into transport network operations\n   proactively supports sustainable
    development.\n\n   This document presents two transport network level GREEN use
    cases,\n   aiming to facilitate discussions within the GREEN Working Group on\n
    \  the potential benefits, challenges, and requirements.  The use cases\n   follow
    a structured template that is proposed for all GREEN use\n   cases, ensuring consistency
    and comparability across different\n   scenarios.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Knowledge of what bandwidths the end-points intend to use is\n   important
    both for the other end-point and for resource allocation in\n   various types
    of networks.  This is especially important for wireless\n   access networks which
    typically have quite limited resources.  The\n   bandwidth attribute in Session
    Description Protocol (SDP), 'b=AS', is\n   today quite widely used to define the
    bandwidth that the end-points\n   intends to use, in various types of sessions.
    \ This document will\n   show that the existing bandwidth attribute, such as 'b=AS',
    although\n   widely used in today's scenarios, has limitations that make it hard\n
    \  or even impossible for the end-points to express their intentions\n   accurately
    when it comes to bandwidth usage.  To solve the identified\n   problems, this
    document defines a new extensible SDP bandwidth\n   attribute 'a=bw' which enables
    more detailed control over the\n   bandwidth declarations, request, and allocations.
    \ With the new\n   bandwidth attribute it is possible to define different scopes
    in the\n   session setup and then negotiate the bandwidth individually for each\n
    \  scope.\n\n\t "

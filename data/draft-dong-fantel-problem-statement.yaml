abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern networks require adaptive traffic manipulation including Traffic
    Engineering (TE), load balancing, flow control and protection etc. to support
    applications like AI training and real-time services. A good and timely understanding
    of network operational status, such as congestion and failures, can help improve
    utilization, reduce latency, and enable faster response to critical events. This
    document describes the existing problems and why the IETF may need a new set of
    fast notification related solutions to support any high- throughput, low-latency
    and lossless application.</p>"

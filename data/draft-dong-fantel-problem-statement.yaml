abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern networks require adaptive traffic manipulation including Traffic
    Engineering (TE), load balancing, flow control, and protection, to support high-throughput,
    low-latency, and lossless applications such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine
    Learning (ML) training and real-time services. A good and timely understanding
    of network operational status, such as congestion and failures, can help to improve
    network utilization, enable the selection of paths with reduced latency, and enable
    faster response to critical events. This document describes the existing problems
    and why a new set of fast network notification solutions are needed.</p>"

  content: "This document is an interim report into pre-emption in MPLS systems.\n\nAt
    the 58th IETF, the MPLS Working Group determined that there are\nseveral interpretations
    of how pre-emption should be achieved within\nMPLS systems. This document is the
    result of the initial enquiries to\nvendors and other implementors into the question
    of how and why they\noffer pre-emption funtion in their MPLS inplementations.\n\nThis
    document is intended to be a short-lived document and only\nexists to document
    the current findings. It will be superceded or\nretired.\n\t "

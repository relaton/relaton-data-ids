  content: "\n   The multiple care-of addresses registration protocol [1] allows a\n
    \  mobile node to maintain, at the same time, multiple virtual paths\n   with
    its home agent or correspondent nodes.  This document presents a\n   policy data
    set for flow distribution to be used with the multiple\n   care-of addresses registration
    protocol.  This policy data set\n   defines policies, in an OS-independant manner,
    for a mobile node and\n   its home agent or correspondent node, from the point
    of view of one\n   of these nodes.  This data set is aimed to be processed by
    this node\n   and the output is a set of filter rules to be used and exchanged
    with\n   its correspondents.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This specification defines a new protocol sw103k addresses challenges\n
    \  in networks with limited bandwidth, latency constraints, and data\n   integrity
    concerns.  It provides compression and decompression to\n   optimize bandwidth
    utilization in environments such as Data centers,\n   internet exchange points,
    and mobile communications.  The protocol\n   operates at the data link layer with
    a custom frame format including\n   SW103K and HAVI headers.  Key features include:\n\n
    \  - Batch processing of 103 packets with compression - Merkle tree-\n   based
    integrity verification (merklesw103k root hash) - QoS\n   mechanisms with 8-bit
    priority field - Security features including\n   AES-256-GCM encryption - Physical
    layer synchronization with +-1us\n   accuracy\n\n   Jutifying why sw103k is unique:\n\n
    \  The sw103k protocol is a Layer-2 mechanism that applies stateful\n   compression
    to complete payloads using shared context between\n   communicating entities.\n\n
    \  The protocol assumes that traffic in constrained networks is often\n   structured
    and repetitive and therefore allows endpoints to provision\n   payload templates,\n\n
    \  dictionaries, and delta-encoding state prior to data exchange.\n\n   During
    operation, payloads may be represented by compact identifiers\n   together with
    fields that describe deviations from previously\n   established state.\n\n   For
    traffic patterns that conform to these assumptions,\n\n   this approach can substantially
    reduce the number of transmitted\n   octets and may achieve compression ratios
    on the order of 103:1\n   for selected telemetry and control messages.  By operating\n
    \  independently of IP version, transport protocol, and application\n   encoding,\n\n
    \  sw103k is intended to reduce airtime usage, energy consumption, and\n   the
    need for fragmentation in environments where link capacity and\n   device resources
    are limited.\n\n\t "

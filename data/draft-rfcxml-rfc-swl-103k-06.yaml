abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a new protocol sw103k addresses challenges
    in networks with limited bandwidth, latency constraints, and data integrity concerns.
    It provides compression and decompression to optimize bandwidth utilization in
    environments such as Data centers, internet exchange points, and mobile communications.
    The protocol operates at the data link layer with a custom frame format including
    SW103K and HAVI headers. Key features include: - Batch processing of 103 packets
    with compression - Merkle tree- based integrity verification (merklesw103k root
    hash) - QoS mechanisms with 8-bit priority field - Security features including
    AES-256-GCM encryption - Physical layer synchronization with +-1us accuracy Jutifying
    why sw103k is unique: The sw103k protocol is a Layer-2 mechanism that applies
    stateful compression to complete payloads using shared context between communicating
    entities. The protocol assumes that traffic in constrained networks is often structured
    and repetitive and therefore allows endpoints to provision payload templates,
    dictionaries, and delta-encoding state prior to data exchange. During operation,
    payloads may be represented by compact identifiers together with fields that describe
    deviations from previously established state. For traffic patterns that conform
    to these assumptions, this approach can substantially reduce the number of transmitted
    octets and may achieve compression ratios on the order of 103:1 for selected telemetry
    and control messages. By operating independently of IP version, transport protocol,
    and application encoding, sw103k is intended to reduce airtime usage, energy consumption,
    and the need for fragmentation in environments where link capacity and device
    resources are limited.</p>"

  content: "   This Document proposes two extension schemes of PMIPv6, called\n   Query-based
    PMIPv6 (QPMIPv6) and Signaling Query-based PMIPv6 (S-\n   QPMIPv6), which send
    the binding query messages to LMA to get the\n   care-of-address of a mobile node
    and to deliver the subsequent data\n   packet over optimized data path. The proposed
    two schemes have some\n   differences with each other. We will show that the performances
    of\n   the schemes comparing PMIPv6 with QPMIPv6 and S-QPMIPv6.\n\n\t "

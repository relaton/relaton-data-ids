abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The objective of this draft is to propose an IP service model for a\nnon-packet
    switch capable optical network where G.LSPs are\ndynamically triggered by the
    IP layer and subsequently advertised\nfor IP routing. The business model assumes
    that several IP service\ndomains, some of which represent different administrative
    entities,\nshare the same optical backbone and focuses therefore primarily on\nan
    overlay model. G-MPLS signaling (refer to [g-mpls]) with UNI\nsupport is assumed
    as underlying control plane protocol.\n\t "

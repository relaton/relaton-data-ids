  script: Latn
  content: "It is desirable to allow firewalls and intrusion detection systems to\nbe
    able to inspect the payload of an ESP packet that has been\nencrypted with the
    NULL cipher.  This would allow a firewall to read\nthe contents and apply the
    normal policies to it.  However, a device\nin the network cannot reliably determine
    which ESP packets are NULL\nencrypted, and cannot easily determine other ESP format
    parameters\nsuch as the ICV length.  These issues can cause misclassification
    of\npackets and wasted computational resources.\n\nThis document solves this problem
    by defining an authentication-only\nprofile of ESP and reserving IP protocol numbers
    for it.\n\t "

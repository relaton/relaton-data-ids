  content: "   Distributed Mobility Managment(DMM) aims to eliminate the centralized\n
    \  anchor point of current IP mobility solutions to get better\n   scalability
    and optimize the data plane routing.  Many soulutions\n   have been proposed in
    DMM working group but before defining any new\n   DMM protocol, it is a good approach
    to investigate first whether it\n   is feasible to deploy current IP mobility
    protocol in DMM scenario in\n   a way that can meet all the requirment of DMM.This
    document discusses\n   the way of the deployment of current IP mobility protocol
    in DMM\n   scenario and analyses the gaps between this approach and the DMM\n
    \  requirment.\n\n\n\t "

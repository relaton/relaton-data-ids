abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document introduces re-ECN (re-inserted explicit congestion\n
    \  notification), which is intended to make a simple but far-reaching\n   change
    to the Internet architecture.  The sender uses the IP header\n   to reveal the
    congestion that it expects on the end-to-end path.  The\n   protocol works by
    arranging an extended ECN field in each packet so\n   that, as it crosses any
    interface in an internetwork, it will carry a\n   truthful prediction of congestion
    on the remainder of its path.  It\n   can be deployed incrementally around unmodified
    routers.  The purpose\n   of this document is to specify the re-ECN protocol at
    the IP layer\n   and to give guidelines on any consequent changes required to\n
    \  transport protocols.  It includes the changes required to TCP both as\n   an
    example and as a specification.  It briefly gives examples of\n   mechanisms that
    can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond\n   sufficiently to congestion,
    but these are described more fully in a\n   companion document.\n\n   Note concerning
    Intended Status: If this draft were ever published as\n   an RFC it would probably
    have historic status.  There is limited\n   space in the IP header, so re-ECN
    had to compromise by requiring the\n   receiver to be ECN-enabled otherwise the
    sender could not use re-ECN.\n   Re-ECN was a precursor to chartering of the IETF's
    Congestion\n   Exposure (ConEx) working group, but during chartering there were\n
    \  still too few ECN receivers enabled, therefore it was decided to\n   pursue
    other compromises in order to fit a similar capability into\n   the IP header.\n\n\t "

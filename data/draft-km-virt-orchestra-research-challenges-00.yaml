  content: "   This document describes open research challenges for emerging media-\n
    \  oriented ensemble applications.  One such driving scenario is the\n   network
    delivery of virtual orchestra that imposes multi-disciplinary\n   challenges.
    \ Specifically, of interest are the group communication\n   patterns in the production,
    delivery and consumption as different\n   dimensions relating to the communication
    networks.\n   This document brings forth current research and engineering\n   challenges
    in immersive media ensembles.  The network domain problems\n   come down to the
    specification of coordination of the received\n   content with dependency constraints.
    \ The challenges depict both real\n   and quasi- realtime behavior.  A number
    of endpoint actors get\n   involved in delivering the ensemble aspect, the research
    challenges\n   also describe the expectations from the end points.\n\n\t "

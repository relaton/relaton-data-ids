abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "     This is a candidate proposal for one way which the problems with\n
    \    the reply-to header in email could be resolved.  Under no\n     circumstances
    should this be implemented as it is only a candidate\n     for a solution and
    no decision has yet been made.  This proposal\n     distinguishes the different
    incompatible uses of the Reply-To\n     header with a new Reply-To-Meaning header.
    \ This has the advantage\n     of being relatively simple, not invalidating most
    current practices\n     and allowing mail user agents to present more predictable
    user\n     interfaces.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Recent research work has delved deeply into a new type of DNS\n   security
    service, Protective DNS, through various measurement\n   methods, and it has been
    deployed in multiple DNS providers and even\n   in national ISPs.  Protective
    DNS identifies whether the domain names\n   requested by customers are in the
    threat intelligence (blocklist) it\n   maintains.  For domain names listed in
    the blocklist, it rewrites the\n   resolution results to secure resources to prevent
    users from\n   accessing malicious resources, such as malicious servers (IP\n
    \  addresses), etc.  This document summarizes the conclusions of these\n   research
    works and provides specific and practical considerations and\n   suggestions for
    the deployment and operation of Protective DNS.  By\n   following these considerations,
    Protective DNS service providers can\n   effectively enhance the practicality
    and security of their services.\n\n\t "

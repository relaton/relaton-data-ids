  content: "   Translation of IP addresses to domain names is an optional feature
    of\n   DNS.  Many sites implement it in someway, many others do not\n   implement
    it at all.  Over time, some myths have developed regarding\n   reverse DNS mapping.
    \ The goal of this document is to to identify\n   best practices, illuminate false
    assumptions and to report on the\n   status of reverse DNS facilities so that
    DNS Administrators and\n   operators can make informed decisions about the options
    for DNS\n   reverse mapping.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Multipath TCP (MPTCP), described in [3], is an extension to TCP to\n
    \  provide the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between\n   hosts.\n\n
    \  MPTCP currently specifies a single authentication mechanism, using\n   keys
    that are initially exchanged in the clear.  There are\n   application-layer protocols
    that may have better information as to\n   the identity of the parties and so
    is able to better provide keying\n   material that could be used for the authentication
    of future\n   subflows.\n\n   This document specifies \"application layer authentication\"
    for\n   Multipath TCP, an alternatively negotiated keying mechanism for\n   MPTCP.\n\n\t "

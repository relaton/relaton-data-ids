  content: "   Recognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries,\n
    \  a number of standards have been developed and services deployed that\n   that
    encrypt a user's DNS queries to the recursive resolver and thus\n   obscure them
    from some network observers and from the user's Internet\n   service provider.
    \ However, these systems merely transfer trust to a\n   third party.  We argue
    that no single party should be able to\n   associate DNS queries with a client
    IP address that issues those\n   queries.  To this end, this document specifies
    Oblivious DNS (ODNS),\n   which introduces an additional layer of obfuscation
    between clients\n   and their queries.  To accomplish this, ODNS uses its own\n
    \  authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the ODNS\n   namespace
    act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they\n   receive, but they
    never see the IP addresses for the clients that\n   initiated these queries.  The
    ODNS experimental protocol is\n   compatible with existing DNS infrastructure.\n\n\t "

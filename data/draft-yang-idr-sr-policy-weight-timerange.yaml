  content: "   Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly\n   indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR\n   Policy is a set
    of candidate paths, each consisting of one or more\n   segment lists.\n\n   In
    the scenario where there are multiple segment list paths, traffic\n   load balancing
    can be achieved based on the weight value assigned to\n   each path. Typically,
    the weight value for each path is fixed. This\n   document defines an extension
    of BGP SR Policy for setting the\n   weight value for each path based on time
    range.\n\n\t "

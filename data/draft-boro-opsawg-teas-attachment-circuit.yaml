abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a YANG service data model for Attachment Circuits
    (ACs). The model can be used for the provisioning of ACs prior or during service
    provisioning (e.g., Network Slice Service). The document specifies also a module
    that updates other service and network modules with the required information to
    bind specific services to ACs that are created using the AC service model. The
    AC service model is designed with the intent to be reusable. Whether a service
    model reuses structures defined in the AC service model or simply include an AC
    reference is a design choice of these service models. Relying upon the AC model
    to manage ACs over which a service is delivered has the merit to decorrelate the
    management of a service vs. upgrade the AC components to reflect recent AC technologies
    or features. Each AC is identified with a unique identifier within a domain. The
    mapping between this AC and a PE that terminates the AC is hidden to the application/customer
    that makes use of the AC service model. Such an information is internal to the
    network controller. Thus, the details about the (network node-specific) attachment
    interfaces are not exposed in this service model.</p>"

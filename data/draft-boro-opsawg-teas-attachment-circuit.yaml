abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a YANG service data model for Attachment Circuits
    (ACs). The model can be used for the provisioning of ACs prior or during service
    provisioning (e.g., Network Slice Service). The model is designed with the intent
    to be reusable. Whether a service model reuses structures defined in the AC service
    model or simply include an AC reference is a design choice of these service models.
    Relying upon the AC model to manage ACs over which a service is delivered has
    the merit to decorrelate the management of a service vs. upgrade the AC components
    to reflect recent AC technologies or features. Each AC is identified with a unique
    identifier within a domain. The mapping between this AC and a PE that terminates
    the AC is hidden to the application/customer that makes use of the AC service
    model. Such an information is internal to the network controller. Thus, the details
    about the (network node-specific) attachment interfaces are not exposed in this
    service model.</p>"

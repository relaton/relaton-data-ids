- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a scheme for overlapped block motion\n   compensation
    that could be incorporated into a next-generation video\n   codec.  The scheme
    described is that currently used by Xiph's Daala\n   project, which supports variable
    block sizes without introducing any\n   discontinuities at block boundaries.  This
    makes the scheme suitable\n   for use with lapped transforms or other techniques
    where encoding\n   such discontinuities is expensive.\n\n\t "

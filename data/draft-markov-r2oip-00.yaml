  script: Latn
  content: "A way of sending of telephone interexchange R2 signals over the \nInternet
    is presented. Signals are sent as named events. All \nsignals/events are divided
    in four groups. The label of the group is \ntransferred as payload type, and type
    of signal inside the group is \ntransferred as an event code. Transfer of signaling
    packets over the \nReal-time Transport Protocol (RTP) utilizes sequencing, numbering
    \nand timestamping provided by this protocol. Packets used to transfer \nthe long
    lasting line signals are intensively transferred only after \nthe change. Labelling
    of start and the end of signal is performed by \nmarker fields in the header and
    payload. The reliability of transfer \ncan be increased using the well-known methods
    of redundant transfer.\n\n\t "

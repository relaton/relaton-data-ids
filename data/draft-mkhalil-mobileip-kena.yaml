  content: "As deployment of global IP networks become more widespread, there\nare
    several challenges that become apparent, one of the more\nimportant ones being
    secure access from a users perspective. Based\non the users service requirements,
    secure access will have to be\nsetup between a multitude of nodes in a distributed
    fashion. The\nnature of these security requirements may well be real-time and\ndynamic
    in nature and MUST protect the confidentiality of the user.\nThese requirements
    are clearly manifested in the mobility domain.\nThis draft outlines a general
    purpose Key Exchange framework for\nNetwork Architectures [KENA] with centralised
    key generation and\nmanagement tailored for distributed nodes. The draft also
    describes\na specific implementation of KENA in the IP mobility domain by\nextending
    Mobile IP [Perkins96].\n\n\t "

  content: "The Internet is evolving to become a more ubiquitous network, driven\nby
    the low prices of wireless routers and access points and by the\nusers' requirements
    of connectivity anytime and anywhere.  For that\nreason, a cloud of nodes connected
    by wireless technology is being\ncreated at the edge of the Internet.  We refer
    to this cloud as a\nFringe Stub (FS).  It is expected that networking in the FS
    will be\nhighly unmanaged and ad-hoc, but at the same time will need to offer\nexcellent
    service availability.  The NEMO Basic Support protocol\ncould be used to provide
    global reachability for a mobile access\nnetwork within the FS and the Tree-Discovery
    mechanism could be used\nto avoid the formation of loops in this highly unmanaged
    structure.\nSince Internet connectivity in mobile scenarios can be costly,\nlimited
    or unavailable, there is a need to enable local routing\nbetween the Mobile Routers
    within a portion of the FS.  This form of\nlocal routing is useful for Route Optimization
    (RO) between Mobile\nRouters that are communicating directly in a portion of the
    FS.\n\nNetwork In Node Advertisement (NINA) is the second of a 2-passes\nrouting
    protocol; a first pass, Tree Discovery, builds a loop-less\nstructure -- a tree
    --, and the second pass, NINA, exposes the Mobile\nNetwork Prefixes (MNPs) up
    the tree.  The protocol operates as a\nmulti-hop extension of Neighbor Discovery
    (ND), to populate TD-based\ntrees with prefixes, and establish routes towards
    the MNPs down the\ntree, from the root-MR towards the MR that owns the prefix,
    whereas\nthe default route is oriented towards the root-MR.\n\nThe NINA protocol
    introduces a new option in the ND Neighbor\nAdvertisement (NA), the Network In
    Node Option (NINO).  An NA with\nNINO(s) is called a NINA (Network In Node Advertisement).
    \ NINA is\ndesigned for a hierarchical model, and by using this NA based\napproach
    it abstracts the embedded network of a Mobile Router as a\nhost to the upper level
    of network abstraction.  With NINA, a Mobile\nRouter presents its sub-tree to
    its parent as an embedded network and\nhides the inner topology and movements.\n\t "

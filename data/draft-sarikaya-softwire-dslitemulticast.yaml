  content: "   This memo specifies modifications required to Dual-Stack Lite (DS-\n
    \  Lite) so that both IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4\n   servers.\n\n
    \  The DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand\n   element
    (B4) proxying Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and\n   then tunneling
    IGMP messages over IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to DS-Lite\n   Address Family Transition
    Router element (AFTR).  IPv4 multicast data\n   received at AFTR is tunneled over
    IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to B4 and\n   then delivered to the hosts.  This solution
    integrates well with DS-\n   Lite unicast solution by using IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire
    and works with\n   unicast IPv6 network connecting B4 with AFTR.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the incorporation of a Reject message to \n\nICMP
    to improve a server’s ability for controlling TCP \n\nconnection requests during
    periods of overload beyond dropping \n\nthem.  The Reject message serves two purposes:
    (1) it can inform \n\na connecting host (the client) to completely abort the \n\nconnection
    attempt as if a connection timeout has expired, and \n\n(2) modify the retransmission
    timeout interval to reduce the \n\nclient’s wait times and also to break the re-synchronization
    of \n\nconnection requests when multiple SYN packets are dropped.  \n\nIntroducing
    an additional ICMP message, as opposed to modifying \n\nthe behavior of TCP, was
    motivated by the need for backward \n\ncompatibility (i.e., a host can ignore
    the ICMP Reject message \n\nwithout affecting the behavior of TCP) and incremental
    \n\ndeployment. \n\n         \n\t "

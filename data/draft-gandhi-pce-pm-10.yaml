  content: "   In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss,\n
    \  delay and delay variation as well as bandwidth utilization are\n   critical
    measures for Traffic Engineering (TE).  This data provides\n   operators the characteristics
    of their networks for performance\n   evaluation that is required to ensure the
    Service Level Agreements\n   (SLAs).\n\n   The Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to
    perform path\n   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs')\n
    \  requests.  The Stateful PCE extensions allow Stateful control of\n   Traffic
    Engineering Paths using PCEP for RSVP and Segment Routing\n   (SR).\n\n   This
    document describes PCEP extensions for enabling and reporting\n   end-to-end performance
    measurements and liveness detection for both\n   PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated
    LSPs for RSVP-TE and SR-TE (for MPLS\n   and IPv6 data planes) to an Active Stateful
    PCE.\n\n\t "

  content: "In the IANA registry of Resource Record (RR) TYPEs, as of October 1,\n2011,
    there are 10 type code values allocated with references that\nare individual email
    boxes and not stable documents.  Some of the\nregistrations represent works in
    progress and such a reference is\nviable.  Some registrations are dormant or dead
    efforts.  In all\ncases it would be helpful to have some reference to material\ndescribing
    the type.\n\n\n\t "

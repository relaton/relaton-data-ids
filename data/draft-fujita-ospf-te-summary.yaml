- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Various Traffic Engineering extensions for OSPF have been proposed in\n[KATZ,
    OSPFEXT] and others. However, these are basically applicable\nonly to intra-area
    Traffic Engineering since they do not support\ninter-area advertisements of the
    resource information. This draft\nproposes a new scheme for advertising the summarized
    resource\ninformation for Traffic Engineering outside the area. It also\nspecifies
    a new LSA to achieve this advertisement.\n\n\n\t "

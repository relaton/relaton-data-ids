  content: "Media recording enables the parties of a conversation to record all\nor
    part of the conversation.  Automatic recording may bring great\nconvenience to
    users.  However, federal law requires the parties of a\nconversation to have a
    consent for media recording.  In addition, FCC\nrequires the recorded parties
    must be notified before the recording.\nThese requirements make automatic recording
    impossible without\ndefining a mechanism to negotiate the consent and send recording\nnotifications.
    \ This document defines a SIP event package for\nrecording event notifications
    and use the SIP CONSENT method to\nnegotiate a consent among multiple parties
    for media recording.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft discusses the features and functions that the Internet\n
    \  must support in order to be as robust and trustworthy as the public\n   switched
    telephone network (PSTN, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\n   Public_switched_telephone_network).
    \ In general the PSTN-like\n   features and functions include verifiable addressing
    and numbering,\n   higher privacy and security, increased reliability (no more
    than\n   around five minutes of unplanned outage over one year time period),\n
    \  survivability and resiliency, desirable level of scalability, alarms,\n   correlation,
    and diagnosis capability, and local/international level\n   of accountability.
    \ Incorporation of these (or similar) features are\n   expected to harden the
    Internet.\n\n   The topics related to Internet hardening were discussed during
    IETF88\n   technical plenary (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/technical-\n
    \  plenary.html) in Vancouver, BC, Canada in Nov. 2013.  A follow-up\n   joint
    W3C/IAB workshop on strengthening the Internet against\n   pervasive monitoring
    (STRINT, https://www.w3.org/2014/strint) was\n   held before IETF89 meeting in
    London, UK.  During the IETF90\n   Technical Plenary Session\n   (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/minutes/minutes-90-iab-\n
    \  techplenary) on Monday, 21 July 2014 in Toronto, Canada the Technical\n   Topic
    discussion focused on Network topology and geography.  The\n   presentations revealed
    that for business relationship and/or policy\n   reasons, local traffic routinely
    cross national borders for so called\n   'efficient' routing, thereby facilitating
    monitoring, copying, and\n   surveillance of traffic from users' sessions by both
    authorized and\n   unauthorized entities.  All of the technical presentations
    are\n   available at the website of IETF90\n   proceedings(http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/slides/slides-90-iab-\n
    \  techplenary-9.pdf).\n\n   In this draft, we discuss the requirements for PSTNization
    of\n   Internet interfaces, protocols, services, and management and\n   configuration
    capabilities.\n\n   NOTE: We are looking for additional contributors to update
    the\n   contents of Section 2 to Section 6.  If you are interested, please\n   send
    an email to draft-rdsx1-intarea-pstnize-internet@tools.ietf.org\n   with the relevant
    Section Number and Section Title in the Subject\n   line of your email with an
    estimated completion time.\n\n\t "

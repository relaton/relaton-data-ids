  content: "   This document describes an architecture based on the Host Identity
    \n   Protocol (HIP), for active tags, i.e. RFIDs that include tamper \n   resistant
    computing resources, as specified for example in the ISO \n   14443 or 15693 standards.
    HIP-Tags never expose their identity in \n   clear text, but hide this value (typically
    an EPC-Code) by a \n   particular equation (f) that can be only solved by a dedicated
    \n   entity, referred as the portal. HIP exchanges occurred between HIP-\n   Tags
    and portals; they are shuttled by IP packets, through the \n   Internet cloud.

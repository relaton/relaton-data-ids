  content: "\n   This memo introduces the specification of a TFRC sender-based\n   protocol.
    \ This protocol is based on TFRC [2] congestion control and\n   SACK [1] mechanism.
    \ It enlights TFRC processing for the receiver and\n   provides a robust architecture
    against selfish receiver behavior.\n   This protocol remains compliant to the
    common TFRC as defined in [2].\n\n\t "

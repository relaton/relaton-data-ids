abstract:
- content: "<p>The demands on the networking infrastructure and thus the switch/router
    bandwidths are growing exponentially; the drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media
    applications, inter data center communications etc. Using sampling techniques,
    for a given sampling rate, the amount of samples that need to be processed is
    increasing exponentially especially for applications like security threat detection.
    This draft elaborates on flow-state dependent packet selection techniques and
    the relevant information models. It describes how these techniques can be effectively
    used to reduce the number of samples for applications like security threat detection.</p>"

  content: " We present, QoSMIC, a multicast protocol for the Internet that\nsupports
    QoS-sensitive routing, and minimizes the importance of a priori\nconfiguration
    decisions (such as core selection). The protocol is\nresource-efficient, robust,
    flexible, and scalable. In addition, our\nprotocol is provably loop-free.\n \nOur
    protocol starts with a resources-saving tree (Shared Tree) and\nindividual receivers
    switch to a QoS-competitive tree (Source-Based\nTree) when necessary. In both
    trees, the new destination is able to\nchoose the most promising among several
    paths. An innovation is that we\nuse dynamic routing information without relying
    on a link state exchange\nprotocol to provide it. Our protocol limits the effect
    of pre-\nconfiguration decisions drastically, by separating the management from\nthe
    data transfer functions; administrative routers are not necessarily\npart of the
    tree. This separation increases the robustness, and\nflexibility of the protocol.
    Furthermore, QoSMIC is able to adapt\ndynamically to the conditions of the network.\n
    \nThe QoSMIC protocol introduces several new ideas that make it more\nflexible
    than other protocols proposed to date. In fact, many of the\nother protocols,
    (such as YAM, PIM-SM, BGMP, CBT) can be seen as special\ncases of QoSMIC. The
    goal of this document is to present the motivation\nbehind, and the design of
    QoSMIC, and to provide both analytical and\nexperimental results to support our
    claims.\n \n \nNOTE: The text version of the draft is missing several figures,
    that\nfacilitate the understanding of the work.  For this, the authors suggest\nthe
    postscript version.\n\n\t "

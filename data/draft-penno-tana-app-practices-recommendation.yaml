  content: "Applications routinely open multiple TCP connections.  For example, \nP2P
    applications maintain connections to a number of different peers \nwhile web browsers
    perform concurrent download from the same web \nserver.  Application designers
    pursue different goals when doing so:  \n \n \n P2P apps need to maintain a well-connected
    mesh in the swarm while \nweb browsers mainly use multiple connections to parallelize
    requests \nthat involve application latency on the web server side.  But this
    \npractice also has impacts to the host and the network as a whole. For \nexample,
    an application can obtain a larger fraction of the \nbottleneck than if it had
    used fewer connections. Although capacity \nis the most commonly considered bottleneck
    resource, middlebox state \ntable entries are also an important resource for an
    end system \ncommunication.  \n\nThis documents clarifies the current practices
    of application design \nand reasons behind them, and discusses the tradeoffs surrounding
    the \nuse of many concurrent TCP connections to one destination and/or to \ndifferent
    destinations. Other resource types may exist, and the \nguidelines are expected
    to comprehensively discuss them.  \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 Error! \nReference source not found..\n\t "

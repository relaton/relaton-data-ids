  content: "   This document describes usecases and requirements for MPLS big label.\n
    \  The MPLS label format and encoding method have been specified in [RFC\n   3032],
    the label value is represented by 20-bit space and support up\n   to 1 million
    of instances. This proven technology has been widely\n   deployed and worked fine
    for years. However in certain network\n   deployment scenarios of recent years,
    the 20-bit MPLS label space is\n   no longer sufficient to support the widespread
    adoption of network\n   virtualization technologies. In what follows we will describe
    each of\n   the usecase respectively\n\n\t "

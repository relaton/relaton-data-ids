  content: "   Current routing mechanism based on the shortest path, only the path\n
    \  accessibility is considered, but the security of links and forwarding\n   nodes
    is not considered.  As security has become an important factor\n   in the service
    layer. this paper proposes to add a new factor:\n   security.\n\n   The frequent
    occurrence of security incidents, users' demand for\n   security services is essential.
    \ As there are many security devices\n   in the ISP's network, this draft proposes
    secure routing, the purpose\n   of secure routing is to converge security and
    routing to ensure the\n   security of the transmission process.\n\n   The scope
    is transmission process security, while end-to-end security\n   and application
    layer security are out of scope.\n\n\t "

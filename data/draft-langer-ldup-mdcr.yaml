  content: "Concurrent changes in a Multi-Master directory are a partially \nordered
    tree. 'LDUP Update Reconciliation Procedures' (URP) uses \ntimestamps to impose
    a strict linear order on this tree, and merges \nchanges to fit that imposed order.
    Merged changes violate the \nsemantics of the LDAP/X.500 data model. No specific
    'modifierName' \ncan be assigned to a merged change and requirements to support
    audit \ntrails and access controls and not to break applications or impede \nfuture
    work on transactions cannot be met. The current LDUP \nrequirements draft avoids
    dealing with these critical issues. \n\n\t "

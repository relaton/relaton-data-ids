  content: "   With the open and standard programmatic interface and the flexibility\n
    \  of controlling network, Software Defined Network (SDN) can obviously\n   simplify
    and integrate operation and business support systems. As a\n   consequence, to
    satisfy the rising switching demand in the data\n   center network, it is a good
    option to adopt SDN technology. In\n   addition, current architecture of data
    center network is far from\n   ideality, which results in the low utilization
    rate in bandwidth\n   resource. For example, mice flow cannot be well effectively
    served in\n   the conventional Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical\n
    \  network with at least 50GHz spectrum interval. From a data center\n   network
    perspective, it is necessary to further improve the resource\n   utilization efficiency
    and the flexibility of coping with different\n   traffic.\n\n   This document
    described an optical data center interconnect, which\n   comprises both the fixed
    and flexible grid transceivers. A traffic\n   monitor is implemented in the SDN-based
    data center network to\n   evaluate the coming traffic demands and allocate appropriate
    spectrum\n   for the request. For instance, mice flow can be served by fixed grid\n
    \  transceivers, well the elephant flows can be transmitted by the\n   flexi-grid
    transceiver using multiple subcarriers to form a\n   superchannel. Thus, spectrum
    efficiency is optimized and bandwidth\n   utilization is improved dramatically.\n\n\t "

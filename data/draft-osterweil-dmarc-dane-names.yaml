  content: "   This document proposes additions to the Domain-based Message\n   Authentication,
    Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) Tag Registry to\n   enable Mail administrators
    to specify the domain-wide policies for S/\n   MIME and PGP key usage in their
    mail domains, in conjunction with use\n   of the DANE SMIMEA and OPENPGPKEY resource
    records.  This would mean\n   adding to the authentication mechanisms specified
    in RFC 7489, but it\n   would specify only the domain-wide policies for S/MIME
    and PGP, such\n   as what the policies are for signing and encrypting (does the
    sender\n   mandate it, not allow it, etc.).  This document also suggests the\n
    \  specification of the type of encoding of the left-hand sides used in\n   the
    DANE resource records.\n\n\t "

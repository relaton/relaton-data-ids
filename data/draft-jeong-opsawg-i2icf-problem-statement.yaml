  content: "   This document specifies the problem statement for the Interface to\n
    \  In-Network Computing Functions (I2ICF) for user services both on the\n   network-level
    and application-level.  In-Network Computing Functions\n   (ICF) include In-Network
    Network Functions (INF) which are defined in\n   the context of Network Functions
    Virtualization (NFV) and Software-\n   Defined Networking (SDN).  ICFs also include
    In-Network Application\n   Functions (IAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things\n
    \  (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial\n   Vehicles
    (UAV).  Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used to compose\n   user services
    and consist of a combination of ICFs in a target\n   network.  This document investigates
    the need for a standard\n   framework with the interfaces for ICFs, in terms of
    applications with\n   the need to run Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the network
    and\n   interoperability among multi-vendor ICFs.\n\n\t "

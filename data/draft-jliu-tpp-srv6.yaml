  content: "   A trusted network path is desired for source authentication and path\n
    \  verification.  The emergence of IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6) may bring\n   the
    opportunity to assemble trusted network paths with a lightweight\n   IP header.
    \ This document describes a trusted network path\n   verification mechanism based
    on SRv6 (Segment Routing to enable\n   Trusted and Private Network Paths, SR-TPP),
    which supports network\n   path verification with path information protection.
    \ SR-TPP extends\n   SRv6 function in protocol header to meet the requirement
    of path\n   compliance.  Path information is sequentially encoded into the\n   segment
    list in SR-TPP so that path information is partially visible\n   to each intermediate
    router.  The distributed verification of SR-TPP\n   also makes it easier to locate
    faults.\n\n\t "

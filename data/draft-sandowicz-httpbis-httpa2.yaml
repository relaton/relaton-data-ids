  content: "   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Attestable version 2 (HTTPA/2) is an\n
    \  HTTP extension.  It is a transaction-based protocol agnostic to\n   Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) in which the Trusted Execution\n   Environment (TEE) is considered
    a new type of requested resource over\n   the Internet.  The original Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol Attestable\n   (HTTPA) (referred to as HTTPA/1 in the rest of
    the document) includes\n   remote attestation (RA) process onto the HTTPS protocol
    in the\n   assumption of using Transport Layer Security (TLS) across the\n   Internet.
    \ In contrast, the design of HTTPA/2 could establish a\n   trusted (attested)
    and more secure communication without dependence\n   on TLS.\n\n   The definition
    of Attestation for the purposes of this draft:\n\n   The process of vouching for
    the accuracy of TEE based services,\n   configuration, and data where the TEE
    conveys Evidence about its\n   environment, roots of trust and protected functions.
    \ The Evidence is\n   a digital expression of TEE trustworthiness.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The RSVP [RFC2205] model for communicating requests to network\ndevices
    along a datapath has proven useful for a variety of appli-\ncations beyond what
    the protocol designers envisioned, and while\nthe architectural model generalizes
    well the protocol itself has a\nnumber of features that limit its applicability
    to applications\nother than IntServ [RFC1633].  The NSIS working group is developing\na
    modernized version that, among other things, is based on a 'two-\nlayer' architecture
    that divides protocol function into transport\nand application.  This document
    describes the transport protocol.\n\n\t "

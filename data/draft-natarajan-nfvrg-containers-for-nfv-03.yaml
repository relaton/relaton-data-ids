abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally, NFV platforms were limited to using standard virtualization
    technologies (e.g., Xen, KVM, VMWare, Hyper-V, etc.) running guests based on general-purpose
    operating systems such as Windows, Linux or FreeBSD. More recently, a number of
    light-weight virtualization technologies including containers, unikernels (specialized
    VMs) and minimalistic distributions of general-purpose OSes have widened the spectrum
    of possibilities when constructing an NFV platform. This draft describes the challenges
    in building such a platform and discusses to what extent these technologies, as
    well as traditional VMs, are able to address them.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>For the resource constrained devices and networks of 6LowApp it is
    essential that the payload of messages are compact. The use of XML to represent
    data in web applications has become almost universal. The interoperability of
    6LowApp with these applications will require that XML can also be carried over
    the embedded web. This document introduces and compares techniques for encoding
    or compressing XML for use with 6LowApp including EXI, BXML and Fast Infoset.
    The performance and requirements for using these encodings are analyzed in the
    scope of 6LowApp. It is shown that these standard encodings can represent XML
    in a compact form, with reasonable overhead, and require only Internet media type
    and content transfer encoding indication from the application protocol.</p>"

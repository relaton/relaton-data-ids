  script: Latn
  content: "   Network Slicing is meant to enable creating (end-to-end) partitioned\n
    \  network infrastructure that may include the user equipment, access/\n   core
    transport networks, edge and central data center resources to\n   provide differentiated
    connectivity behaviors to fulfill the\n   requirements of distinct services, applications
    and customers.  In\n   this context, connectivity is not restricted to differentiated\n
    \  forwarding capabilities but it covers also advanced service functions\n   that
    will be invoked when transferring data within a given domain.\n\n   The purpose
    of this document is to focus on use cases that benefit\n   from the use of network
    slicing.\n\n\t "

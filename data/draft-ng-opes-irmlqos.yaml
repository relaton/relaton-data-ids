  content: "The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based \nlanguage
    that can be used to describe service-specific execution \nrules for network edge
    intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge \nServices (OPES) framework, as described
    in [3] and [4].  This memo \nillustrates examples of employing the IRML for Quality
    of Service \n(QoS) policing and control, and proposes a QoS sub-system extension
    \nto IRML for better QoS support in the OPES framework.\n\t "

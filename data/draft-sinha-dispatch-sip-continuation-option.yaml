  content: "   Before placing a call, it is quite often useful for the Caller to\n
    \  know whether a Callee is in favorable state to receive a call or\n   not. This
    document defines an optional tag \"continue\" and a header\n   \"Continue\" to
    address the purpose.  The \"Continue\" header field is\n   to confirm the session
    continuity with the Callee from the Caller\n   after an option for session continuity
    is placed by the Callee based\n   on the unfavorable state of the Callee.  This
    functionality is needed\n   to resolve the unwillingness of the Callee to receive
    any call. An\n   option is given to the Callee by the Service Provider or by the\n
    \  Handset Manufacturer or by the Carrier to establish this requirement.\n\n\n\t "

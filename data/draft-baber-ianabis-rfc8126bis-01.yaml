abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants\n
    \  to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values\n   in
    these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote\n   interoperability,
    their allocations are often coordinated by a\n   central record keeper.  For IETF
    protocols, that role is filled by\n   the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    (IANA).\n\n   To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance\n   describing
    the conditions under which new values should be assigned,\n   as well as when
    and how modifications to existing values can be made,\n   is needed.  This document
    defines a framework for the documentation\n   of these guidelines by specification
    authors, in order to assure that\n   the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations
    is clear and\n   addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation
    of a\n   registry.\n\n   This is the fourth edition of this document; it obsoletes
    RFC 8126.\n\n\t "

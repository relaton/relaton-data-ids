  content: "Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of these\nusers
    throughout the world have names that are not normally represented\nby the users
    with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would\ntherefore like to use
    their real names in their mailbox names. This\nprotocol describes how mail clients
    can be enhanced to display mailbox\nnames in non-ASCII characters through the
    use of a new RFC 2822 header\nfield called 'Address-map'.\n\n\t "

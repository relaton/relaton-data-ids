  content: "This document describes the support of IETF Integrated Services over LANs
    built from IEEE 802 network segments which may be interconnected by draft standard
    IEEE P802.1p switches.                                            It describes
    the practical capabilities and limitations of this technology for supporting Controlled
    Load [8] and Guaranteed Service [9] using the inherent capabilities of the relevant
    802 technologies [5],[6] etc. and the proposed 802.1p queuing features in switches.
    IEEE P802.1p [2] is a superset of the existing IEEE 802.1D bridging specification.
    \ This document provides a functional model for the layer 3 to layer 2 and user-to-network
    dialogue which supports admission control and defines requirements for interoperability
    between switches. The special case of such networks where the sender and receiver
    are located on the same segment is also discussed.       This scheme expands on
    the ISSLL over 802 LANs framework described in [7]. It makes reference to an admission
    control signaling protocol developed by the ISSLL WG which is known as the 'Subnet
    Bandwidth Manager'. This is an extension  to the IETF's RSVP protocol [4] and
    is described in a separate document [10].\n\t "

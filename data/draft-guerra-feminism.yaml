  content: "   This document aims to describe how internet standards, protocols and\n
    \  its implementations may impact diverse groups and communities.  The\n   research
    on how some protocol can be enabler for specific human\n   rights while possibly
    restricting others has been documented in\n   [RFC8280].  Similar to how RFC 8280
    has taken a human rights lens\n   through which to view engineering and design
    choices by internet\n   standardisation, this document addresgses the opportunities
    and\n   vulnerabilities embedded within internet protocols for specific,\n   traditionally
    maginalised groups.\n\n\t "

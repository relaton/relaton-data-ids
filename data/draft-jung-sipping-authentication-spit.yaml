abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo proposes to add a digest message authentication scheme \n
    \  between the inbound proxy and the UAS for protecting SPIT. Spammers \n   can
    directly send SIP calls (such as call spam and IM spam) to the \n   UAS using
    P2P call signaling. For rejecting the SPIT, the UAS should \n   be able to verify
    that the SIP messages are forwarded by the proxy \n   server, not directly from
    spammers. By applying the message digest \n   scheme similar to the HTTP digest,
    the UAS processes the request \n   after assuring that the INVITE message comes
    through the inbound \n   proxy server. The main advantage of this scheme is to
    protect SPIT by\n\n   adding a very simple message authentication scheme between
    the proxy \n   server and the UAS. \n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a dynamic trust security architecture based
    on\n   Distributed Micro Service Communication (DMSC) to address the\n   security
    risks in the communication of microservices.  The DMSC\n   architecture, by leveraging
    content semantic routing and\n   decentralized control, transforms the traditional
    host-centric\n   communication mode into a service-centric paradigm.  Although
    DMSC\n   enhances scalability and flexibility, its distributed nature\n   introduces
    risks.  To cope with these risks, it is necessary to\n   consider security solutions
    for distributed large-scale microservice\n   communication and ensure the security
    of services while minimizing\n   the impact on the communication architecture.\n\n\t "

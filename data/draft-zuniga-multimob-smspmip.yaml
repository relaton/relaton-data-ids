  content: "   The MULTIMOB group has specified a base solution to support IP\n   multicasting
    in a PMIPv6 domain [RFC6224]. In this document, an\n   enhancement is proposed
    to the base solution to use a multicast tree\n   mobility anchor as the topological
    anchor point for multicast\n   traffic, while the MAG remains as an IGMP/MLD proxy.
    This enhancement\n   provides benefits such as reducing multicast traffic replication
    and\n   supporting different PMIPv6 deployments scenarios.\n\n\n\t "

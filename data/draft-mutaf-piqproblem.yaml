  content: "   Private Information Queries (PIQ) is an Internet protocol that allows\n
    \  making a phone number query directly to the target cell phone.  The\n   target
    user can decide whether or not a phone number should be\n   returned; in real-time
    and on a case-by-case basis.\n\n   PIQ may also be used for bootstrapping IKEv2
    (Internet Key Exchange).\n   Along with a phone number, the querier can securely
    obtain a fixed IP\n   address e.g., a Mobile IPv6 home address, exchange certificates
    and\n   initiate IKEv2 with the target host.\n\n\t "

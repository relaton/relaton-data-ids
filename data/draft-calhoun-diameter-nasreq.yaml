  content: "This document describes the DIAMETER extension that is used for AAA\nin
    a PPP/SLIP Dial-Up and Terminal Server Access environment.  This\nextension, combined
    with the base protocol, satisfies the\nrequirements defined in the NASREQ AAA
    criteria specification and the\nROAMOPS AAA Criteria specification.\nGiven that
    it is expected that initial deployments of the DIAMETER\nprotocol in a dial-up
    environment will include legacy systems, this\nextension was carefully designed
    to ease the burden of servers that\nmust perform protocol conversion between RADIUS
    and DIAMETER.  This\nis achieved by re-using the RADIUS address space, eliminating
    the\nneed to perform attribute lookups.\n\t "

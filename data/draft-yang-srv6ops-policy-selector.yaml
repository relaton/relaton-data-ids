abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a source routing paradigm that explicitly
    indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR Policy is
    associated with one or more candidate paths, and each candidate path is either
    dynamic, explicit or composite. This document describes a policy selection mechanism
    among the candidate SRv6 Policies based on network quality in IPv6 environments.</p>"

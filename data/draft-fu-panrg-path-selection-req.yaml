  content: "   Emerging new services have new business characteristics, different\n
    \  from traditional C/S business model, whose most traffic is downstream\n   traffic,
    more and more new business with gradually increasing\n   upstream traffic have
    appeared, such as short videos, live sales etc,\n   . Due to the new traffic characteristics
    of these services, more\n   requirements have been put forward for the choice
    of network paths.\n   In addition, emerging services also put forward new requirements
    for\n   computing.  Only selecting the network path or the service node\n   cannot
    meet the stringent requirements.  The perception of network\n   paths and path
    selection also need to consider the characteristics of\n   the service, and further
    need to coordinate the state of the network\n   side and the service node side.
    \ The application of path-aware\n   networking can assist the terminal to better
    perceive the network\n   status, and also combine the status of the service node
    to achieve\n   on-demand, more fine-grained path selection.\n\n\n\t "

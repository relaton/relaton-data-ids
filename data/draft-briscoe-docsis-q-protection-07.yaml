  content: "   This informational document explains the specification of the queue\n
    \  protection algorithm used in DOCSIS technology since version 3.1.  A\n   shared
    low latency queue relies on the non-queue-building behaviour\n   of every traffic
    flow using it.  However, some flows might not take\n   such care, either accidentally
    or maliciously.  If a queue is about\n   to exceed a threshold level of delay,
    the queue protection algorithm\n   can rapidly detect the flows most likely to
    be responsible.  It can\n   then prevent harm to other traffic in the low latency
    queue by\n   ejecting selected packets (or all packets) of these flows.  The\n
    \  document is designed for four types of audience: a) congestion\n   control
    designers who need to understand how to keep on the 'good'\n   side of the algorithm;
    b) implementers of the algorithm who want to\n   understand it in more depth;
    c) designers of algorithms with similar\n   goals, perhaps for non-DOCSIS scenarios;
    and d) researchers\n   interested in evaluating the algorithm.\n\n\t "

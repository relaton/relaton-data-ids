  content: "   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validation by recursive DNS\n   resolvers
    has been deployed at scale.  However, domain signing tools\n   and processes are
    not yet as mature and reliable as is the case for\n   non-DNSSEC-related domain
    administration tools and processes.  This\n   sometimes results in DNSSEC-validation
    failures, for which operators\n   of validating resolvers are often blamed.  This
    is similar to other,\n   non-DNSSEC-related authoritative DNS errors, for which
    individual\n   recursive DNS operators are sometimes incorrectly blamed.  This\n
    \  document makes clear that responsibility for any and all\n   authoritative
    DNS failures rests squarely with authoritative domain\n   name operators, who
    are the only party that can properly maintain\n   their domain names and rectify
    associated authoritative DNS errors.\n\n\t "

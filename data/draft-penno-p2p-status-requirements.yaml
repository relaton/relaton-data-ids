  content: "The use of P2P protocols by end users is widespread. These protocols \n
    \  are meant to exchange, replicate, stream or download files with \n   little
    human intervention, trying at the same time to minimize the \n   download time
    of the files requested by any single peer. The ubiquity \n   of such P2P networks
    has created a steep rise in subscriber bandwidth\n\t "

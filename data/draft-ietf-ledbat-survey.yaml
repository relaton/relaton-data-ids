- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document provides a survey of transport protocols that are designed
    to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard
    TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it.  Such protocols could be used
    for delay-insensitive \"background\" traffic, as they provide what is sometimes
    called a \"less than\" (or \"lower than\") best-effort service.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

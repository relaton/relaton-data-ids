  content: "This memo describes a key exchange and security negotiation protocol\nwhich
    is intended to depricate [HC98]. As such it will not change the\n'bits on the
    wire' for an implementation which is compiant with\n[HC98] but will clarify contentious
    issues with [HC98] and attempt to\nexplain the protocol in a less haphazard manner.
    Due to advances in\ncomputer processing some mandatory-to-implement attributes
    have\nchanged between this [HC98] and this document. In addition a new and\noptional
    exchange is introduced. Like [HC98] this memo uses [MSST98]\nfor a framework and
    as a language to express exchanges which are\nderived from [Kra96] and [Orm98].\nIn
    places where the requirements between this document and [MSST98]\nor [Kra96] or
    [Orm98] conflict, this document will be supreme.\n\t "

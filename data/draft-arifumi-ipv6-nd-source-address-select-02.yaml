  content: "This document describes a Neighbor Discovery IPv6 Source Address\n   Selection(SAS)
    Policy option for distributing of source address\n   selection policies to end
    nodes.  This option is particularly\n   effective when a consumer site has multiple
    address blocks.  Every\n   end node is guided by such a policy in selecting an
    appropriate\n   source address for each destination address.  This makes it possible\n
    \  for an end node to set up a connection without concern for transfer\n   failures
    due to ingress filtering by ISPs, for ISP operators to\n   manage user behavior
    and networking policy, and for consumers to be\n   provided with networks that
    are almost automatically robust and\n   reliable.\n\t "

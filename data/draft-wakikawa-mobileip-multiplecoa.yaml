  content: "According to the current Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node may\nhave
    several Care-of Addresses, but only one, termed the primary\nCare-of Address,
    can be registered with its home agent and the\ncorrespondent nodes.  However,
    for matters of cost, bandwidth, delay,\netc, it is useful for the mobile node
    to get Internet access through\nmultiple access media simultaneously, in which
    case multiple active\nIPv6 Care-of Addresses would be assigned to the mobile node.
    \ We thus\npropose Mobile IPv6 extensions designed to register multiple Care-of\nAddresses
    bound to a single Home Address instead of the sole primary\nCare-of Address.  For
    doing so, a new identification number must be\ncarried in each binding for the
    receiver to distinguish between the\nbindings corresponding to the same Home Address.
    \ Those extensions\nare targeted to NEMO (Network Mobility) Basic Support as well
    as to\nMobile IPv6.\n\n\n\n\t "

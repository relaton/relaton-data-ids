  content: "   The ability to compute an optimal path for setting up Traffic \n   engineering
    Label Switched Paths spanning multiple autonomous \n   systems managed by different
    operators has been a key requirement in \n   MPLS and GMPLS networks. This document
    specifies a method of \n   computing inter-AS paths consisting of a list of ASes
    to be \n   traversed and a list of TE-Tunnels to be traversed in each AS. The
    \n   method described here uses BGP speakers in the PCEs of each AS to \n   distribute
    the inter-AS connectivity information and the TE-Tunnels \n   in each AS to its
    neighbors to facilitate the construction of an \n   inter-AS topology graph which
    can be used for computing inter-AS\n    paths. \n\n\t "

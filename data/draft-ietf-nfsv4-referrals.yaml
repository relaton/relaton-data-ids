  content: "     RFC3530 describes a migration feature using the NFS4ERR_MOVED error\n
    \    code and the fs_locations attribute.  The description focuses on\n     the
    case of migration (i.e. relocation) of a file system already\n     known to the
    client.  The simpler limiting case in a which a file\n     system not previously
    known to the client was located elsewhere,\n     which we here call a referral,
    was not clearly described.  Because\n     of this and also because of some inconsistencies
    and ambiguities in\n     the text of RFC3530, there has been confusion about how
    the client\n     and server should interact in performing a referral.  This document\n
    \    provides a guide to the implementation of referrals, and in so\n     doing,
    addresses the relevant problems in RFC3530.\n\t "

  content: "   SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism\n   framework
    that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols\n   and attributes.
    \ This framework has been extended with a Media\n   capabilities negotiation mechanism
    that allows endpoints to negotiate\n   additional media-related capabilities.
    \ This negotiation is embedded\n   into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.\n\n
    \  This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow\n   endpoints
    to negotiate a number of miscellaneous SDP capabilities.\n   In particular, this
    memo provides a mechanism to negotiate media\n   titles (\"i=\" line for each
    media), connection data (\"c=\" line), and\n   media bandwidth (\"b=\" line).\n\n\t "

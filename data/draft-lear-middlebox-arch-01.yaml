  content: "It used to be reasonable to expect that any two points connected to\nthe
    Internet to have the ability to hold any communication.  Such an\nexpectation
    has not be reasonable for quite some time, thanks to\nfirewalls, NATs, and other
    intermediate devices.  Today, we\nacknowledge a new architecture and we name the
    functional blocks of\nthat architecture as well as several ways to get ends to
    communicate,\nand how two devices could expect to communicate with each other.\nThis
    document does not define the protocols involved.\n\t "

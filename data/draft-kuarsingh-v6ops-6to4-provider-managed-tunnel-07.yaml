  content: "6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework that can
    help manage 6to4 tunnels operating in an anycast configuration.  The 6to4-PMT
    framework is intended to serve as an option for operators to help improve the
    experience of 6to4 operation when conditions of the network may provide sub-optimal
    performance or break normal 6to4 operation.  6to4-PMT supplies a stable provider
    prefix and forwarding environment by utilizing existing 6to4 relays with an added
    function of IPv6 Prefix Translation.  This operation may be particularly important
    in NAT444 infrastructures where a customer endpoint may be assigned a non-RFC1918
    address, thus breaking the return path for anycast-based 6to4 operation.  6to4-PMT
    has been successfully used in a production network, implemented as open source
    code, and implemented by a major routing vendor.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so that this\n
    \  method can be used to refer to multiple resources. These extensions\n   include
    the use of pointers to URI-lists in the Refer-To header\n   field, the use of
    bodies to describe the requests to be sent by the\n   server, and the use of a
    new event package to report the state of\n   several transactions.\n\t "

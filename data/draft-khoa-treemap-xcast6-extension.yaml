  content: "Xcast6 (Explicit Multi-unicast for IPv6) is a new multicast scheme \nthat
    supports very large number of small multicast sessions. Xcast6 \nsends data via
    optimal route without traffic redundancy when Xcast-\naware routers exist; otherwise,
    data will be sent in daisy-chain \nform. In this document, we propose Xcast6 Treemap
    - an extension of \nXcast6. Using Xcast6 Treemap, data can be branched not only
    at source \nbut also at remote hosts, solving the limitation of daisy-chain \nconnection.
    Xcast6 Treemap utilizes existing multicast infrastructure \n(Xcast-aware routers)
    to improve application performance and reduce \ntraffic redundancy on network;
    also, it automatically switches to \nend-host multicast operation mode in the
    absence of Xcast-aware \nrouter. For widely deployment of Xcast6, routers must
    be upgraded \ngradually. This requires a long term strategy and Xcast6 Treemap
    is a \ngood choice for incremental deployment.\n\t "

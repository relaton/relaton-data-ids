  content: "   This document adds abbreviations to \"DNS Terminology\" (RFC 8499)
    that\n   relate to DNS running over various transports, as well as\n   abbreviations
    for DNS resolution at traditional and non-traditional\n   locations.\n\n   [[
    This is an early attempt at these terms.  They will probably be\n   improved over
    time. []\n\n\t "

  content: "   BGP community usage has continued to increase during the past decade.\n
    \  Unfortunately, while BGP community is a seemingly innocuous feature,\n   it
    can be used to influence routing in unintended ways.  Existing\n   defense mechanisms
    are insufficient to prevent community-based\n   attacks.  This document describes
    some of the scenarios that may be\n   used to launch these attacks and make recommendations
    on practices\n   that may defend them.  In particular, this document proposes\n
    \  SecCommunity, an extension to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that\n   can
    authenticate the ASes who added action community values on the\n   announcements.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo requires support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in all\n
    \  electronic mail user agents (MUAs) and the servers with which they\n   communicate
    when using standard protocols, including Interactive\n   Message Access Protocol
    (IMAP), Post Office Protocol (POP) and the\n   variant of the Simple Message Transfer
    Protocol (SMTP) used in\n   message submission.  It also requires support for
    TLS in mail\n   protocol servers provided by electronic mail service providers,
    and\n   encourages mail service providers to migrate to requiring TLS for all\n
    \  interaction with their servers.  In addition, this memo details\n   specific
    recommendations for implementation and use of TLS with\n   electronic mail protocols
    used in interactions between MUAs and mail\n   service providers.\n\n   Use of
    TLS with SMTP for message relaying is described in a separate\n   document, and
    not in scope for this document.\n\n   The recommendations in this memo do not
    replace the functionality of,\n   and are not intended as a substitute for, end-to-end
    encryption of\n   electronic mail.\n\n\t "

  content: "Work has been progressing in the Common Control and Measurement\nProtocol
    (CCAMP) working group on the application of MPLS technology\nto non-packet switching
    networks.  Development of the Generalized\nMPLS (GMPLS) signaling draft [1] has
    allowed for Optical, SONET/SDH,\nand spatial switching systems to be controlled
    using IP protocols.\nIn a GMPLS network, the path that a TDM connection will use
    is\ndeveloped using constraint based routing.  The developed route\nutilizes TDM
    link state information announced via OSPF or IS-IS by\nother nodes in the network.
    \ However, a node cannot advertise the\nexistence of a link without first identifying
    the remote node\nconnected to the link and the capabilities of the neighboring
    node.\nIn a packet network, this function would typically be accomplished\nusing
    OSPF or IS-IS Hello messages repeated every 10 or so seconds.\nHowever, the TDM
    link cannot transmit similar messages because the\nport terminating the link cannot
    be shared between a TDM service\nuser and the OSPF/IS-IS termination function.\n\t "

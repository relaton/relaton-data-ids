  script: Latn
  content: "   The Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2) allows a client to\n
    \  cache both metadata and data for file objects, as well as metadata\n   for
    directory objects.  While caching directory entries (dirents) can\n   improve
    performance, it can also prevent the server from enforcing\n   access control
    on individual dirents.  Similarly, caching file data\n   can lead to performance
    issues if the cache hit rate is low.  This\n   document introduces a new uncacheable
    attribute for NFSv4.  Files and\n   dirents marked as uncacheable MUST NOT be
    stored in client-side\n   caches.  This ensures data consistency and integrity
    by requiring\n   clients to always retrieve the most recent data directly from
    the\n   server.  This document extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7862).\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "It has become a common practice to use symbolic names (usually CNAMEs)
    in the Domain Name Service (DNS - [RFC-1034, RFC-1035]) to refer to network services
    such as anonymous FTP [RFC-959] servers, Gopher [RFC- 1436] servers, and most
    notably World-Wide Web HTTP [RFC-1945] servers.  This is desirable for a number
    of reasons.  It provides a way of moving services from one machine to another
    transparently, and a mechanism by which people or agents may programmatically
    discover that an organization runs, say, a World-Wide Web server.  Although this
    approach has been almost universally adopted, there is no standards document or
    similar specification for these commonly used names.  This document seeks to rectify
    this situation by gathering together the extant 'folklore' on naming conventions,
    and proposes a mechanism for accommodating new protocols.  This document specifies
    an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

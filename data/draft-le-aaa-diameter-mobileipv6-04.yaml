  content: "   Mobile IPv6 capable mobile nodes can roam between networks that\n   belong
    to their home service provider as well as others. Roaming in\n   foreign networks
    is enabled as a result of the service level and\n   roaming agreements that exist
    between operators. One of the key\n   protocols that allows this kind of a roaming
    mechanism to be enabled\n   is Diameter. This Internet Draft specifies a new application
    to\n   Diameter that enables Mobile IPv6 roaming in networks other than its\n
    \  home.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the Domain-Aware Routing Technology (DART),
    a\n   novel addressing and routing protocol that introduces a Fully\n   Qualified
    Domain Name (FQDN)-centric addressing model.  DART operates\n   over existing
    IP (IPv4 or IPv6) networks and employs the Domain Name\n   System (DNS) as its
    control plane to map domain names to IP\n   addresses.  Within full compatibility
    with current IP infrastructure,\n   DART extends the effective address space to
    infinity, enables\n   seamless communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks, and\n
    \  significantly improves Internet scalability and evolvability.\n\n   By localizing
    the IP address space within each DNS domain, DART\n   provides unlimited address
    reuse and constructs a more aggregated\n   routing structure that alleviates global
    routing table pressure.  The\n   protocol transforms the paradigm from \"IP-based
    addressing\" to\n   \"domain-based addressing,\" laying the foundation for a unified,
    name-\n   driven networking architecture.  DART can be gradually deployed and\n
    \  upgraded without affecting existing communications, requiring\n   hardware
    upgrades only for a small number of critical devices.\n\n   A functional prototype
    of the DART system has been independently\n   developed and deployed on Internet
    by the author.\n\n\t "

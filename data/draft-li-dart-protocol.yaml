abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the Domain-Aware Routing Technology (DART),
    a novel addressing and routing protocol that introduces a Fully Qualified Domain
    Name (FQDN)-centric addressing model. DART operates over existing IP (IPv4 or
    IPv6) networks and employs the Domain Name System (DNS) as its control plane to
    map domain names to IP addresses. Within full compatibility with current IP infrastructure,
    DART extends the effective address space to infinity, enables seamless communication
    between IPv4 and IPv6 networks, and significantly improves Internet scalability
    and evolvability. By localizing the IP address space within each DNS domain, DART
    provides unlimited address reuse and constructs a more aggregated routing structure
    that alleviates global routing table pressure. The protocol transforms the paradigm
    from "IP-based addressing" to "domain-based addressing," laying the foundation
    for a unified, name- driven networking architecture. DART can be gradually deployed
    and upgraded without affecting existing communications, requiring hardware upgrades
    only for a small number of critical devices. A functional prototype of the DART
    system has been independently developed and deployed on Internet by the author.</p>

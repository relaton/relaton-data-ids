  content: "   This draft introduces the concept of a SCHClet, a modular, atomic\n
    \  sub-function within the SCHC (Static Context Header Compression)\n   framework.
    \ Drawing an analogy from chiplet technology in integrated\n   circuits, a SCHClet
    is envisioned as a self-contained unit that\n   encapsulates a specific SCHC function
    or set of functions.  This\n   modular approach allows for tailored implementations
    that can meet\n   diverse use cases without the overhead of a full SCHC apparatus.
    \ By\n   decomposing SCHC functionality into SCHClets, the framework becomes\n
    \  more adaptable, extensible, and easier to deploy generic network\n   environments,
    applicable, but not limited to constrained networks.\n\n   A technology which
    uses a SCHClet can be considered as built using\n   the SCHC Framework.  A generic
    SCHC Framework implementation which\n   has all SCHClets implemented MUST be able
    to interoperate with any\n   SCHClet, provided it has the corresponding configuration.
    \ For\n   example, if one IPsec end-point uses a minimal SCHClet\n   implementation,
    the other end-point may use a full SCHC\n   implementation with the corresponding
    configuration.\n\n   It may be said that a SCHClet is the minimal sub-function\n
    \  corresponding to a given SCHC Context.  In this sense, we can see\n   Ack-On-Err
    Fragmentation as a SCHClet.  We may consider the Ack-\n   Always Fragmentation
    as a SCHClet.  Or we may consider the baseline\n   fragmentations from RFC8724
    (NoAck, AckAlways, AckOnErr) as a\n   SCHClet, with the parameters defining which
    fragmentation mode is\n   used.  In any case, a developer may chose to use only
    the NoAck\n   fragmentation (for example), and in this case they are using the\n
    \  NoAck Fragmentation SCHClet, which can even be further restricted to\n   a
    fixed set of parameters, with different parameters unsupported by\n   the implementation.\n\n\t "

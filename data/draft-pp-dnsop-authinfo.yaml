  content: "   This document defines a new DNS RRtype, AUTHINFO, that is used by\n
    \  authoritative servers to publish information about themselves.  This\n   information
    can be useful because a recursive resolver can determine\n   an authoritative
    server's capabilities, such as whether an\n   authoritative server supports the
    EDNS(0) client subnet extension.\n\n\t "

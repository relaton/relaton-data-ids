abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a framework for intelligent network measurement
    using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). By treating network devices as MCP servers
    and network controllers as MCP clients, this framework enables natural language-driven,
    AI-assisted network measurement operations. The framework leverages MCP's standardized
    communication protocol to provide real-time network performance monitoring, intelligent
    fault diagnosis, topology discovery, and automated measurement workflows. This
    document describes the architecture, use cases, and security considerations for
    implementing MCP-based network measurement systems.</p>"

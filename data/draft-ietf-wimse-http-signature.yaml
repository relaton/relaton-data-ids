  script: Latn
  content: "   The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for\n
    \  software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from the\n   most
    basic ones to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-tenant\n   deployments.
    \ This document defines one of the mechanisms to provide\n   workload authentication,
    using HTTP Signatures.  While only\n   applicable to HTTP traffic, the protocol
    provides end-to-end\n   protection of requests (and optionally, responses), even
    when service\n   traffic is not end-to-end encrypted, that is, when TLS proxies
    and\n   load balancers are used.  Authentication is based on the Workload\n   Identity
    Token (WIT).\n\n\t "

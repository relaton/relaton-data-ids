abstract:
- content: "<p>The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for
    software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from the most basic ones
    to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-tenant deployments. This document
    defines one of the mechanisms to provide workload authentication, using HTTP Signatures.
    While only applicable to HTTP traffic, the protocol provides end-to-end protection
    of requests (and optionally, responses), even when service traffic is not end-to-end
    encrypted, that is, when TLS proxies and load balancers are used. Authentication
    is based on the Workload Identity Token (WIT).</p>"

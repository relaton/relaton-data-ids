  script: Latn
  content: "   After a renumbering event in an IPv6 network utilizing SLAAC, hosts\n
    \  might continue to use stale addresses, as they are unaware of the\n   changes.
    Likewise, routers, who may deprecate the use of these\n   prefixes, are unaware
    of their use on the hosts. This scenario could\n   have an adverse effect on communication
    with the host. This document\n   proposes changes to the SLAAC algorithm that
    will explicitly allow\n   routers to learn of these stale prefixes that are still
    assigned on\n   the network.\n\n\t "

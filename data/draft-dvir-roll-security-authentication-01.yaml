  content: "   Designing a routing protocol for large low-power and lossy networks\n
    \  (LLNs), consisting of thousands of constrained nodes and unreliable\n   links,
    presents new challenges.  The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-\n   power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL), have been developed by the IETF ROLL\n   Working Group as a preferred
    routing protocol to provide IPv6 routing\n   functionality in LLNs.  Unfortunately,
    the currently available\n   security services in RPL will not protect against
    a compromised\n   internal node that can construct and disseminate fake messages.\n
    \  Therefore, in RPL special security care must be taken when the\n   Destination
    Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root is updating\n   the Version Number
    by which reconstruction of the routing topology\n   can be initiated.  The same
    care also must be taken to prevent an\n   internal attacker (compromised DODAG
    node) to publish decreased Rank\n   value, which causes a large part of the DODAG
    to connect to the DODAG\n   root via the attacker and give it the ability to eavesdrop
    or\n   manipulate a large part of the network traffic.  In this document, a\n
    \  new security service is described that prevents any misbehaving DODAG\n   node
    from illegitimately increasing the Version Number or publish\n   illegitimately
    decreased Rank values.\n\n\t "

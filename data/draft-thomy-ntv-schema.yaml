  content: "   The NTV format is an extension of the JSON format integrating a\n   semantic
    dimension through the notion of type.  This format remains\n   compatible with
    the current JSON format but it is relevant to examine\n   its compatibility and
    its impacts with data schemas.  This document\n   provides some answers to this
    question and presents some of the\n   possible developments based mainly on the
    example of JSON Schema and\n   additionally on the example of OpenAPI.\n\n\t "

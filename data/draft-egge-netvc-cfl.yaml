  content: "   Chroma from luma (CfL) prediction is a new and promising chroma-only\n
    \  intra predictor that models chroma pixels as a linear function of the\n   coincident
    reconstructed luma pixels.  In this document, we propose\n   the CfL predictor
    adopted in Alliance Video 1 (AV1) to the NETVC\n   working group.  The proposed
    CfL distinguishes itself from prior art\n   not only by reducing decoder complexity,
    but also by producing more\n   accurate predictions.  On average, CfL reduces
    the BD-rate, when\n   measured with CIEDE2000, by 5% for still images and 2% for
    video\n   sequences.\n\n\t "

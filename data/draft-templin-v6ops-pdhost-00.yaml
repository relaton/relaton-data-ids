- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which\n
    \  then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.\n   The
    requesting router then acts as a router between the downstream-\n   attached hosts
    and the upstream provider network.  The router could\n   also act as a host under
    the weak end system model, and otherwise\n   behaves as a standard router.  This
    document considers the case when\n   the \"requesting router\" is actually a host,
    and receives a prefix\n   that it can use for multi-addressing purposes.  The
    host does not\n   connect any downstream-attached networks, and uses the prefix
    solely\n   for its own multi-addressing purposes.\n\n\t "

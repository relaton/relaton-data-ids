  content: "This document extends local routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and\ndefines
    a localized routing optimization protocol between Mobility\nAccess Gateways within
    a single provider domain.  The protocol\nsupports operation over IPv4 transport
    networks, IPv4 home address\nmobility and handover.  The Local mobility anchor
    initiated and\nmobile access gateway initiated local routing are allowed to setup\nlocal
    routing path between the mobile and correspondent node by\nsending messages to
    the corresponding mobile access gateway or local\nmobility anchor.  If the MN
    & CN are anchored with two different LMAs\nthen the MN-LMA must discover which
    LMA the CN is registered with\nbefore an optimized local routing path can be established.
    \ Mobile\nAccess Gateways create and refresh bindings using proxy binding\nupdate
    and acknowledgement messages.\n\t "

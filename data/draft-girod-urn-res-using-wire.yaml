  content: "The identifier resolution extensions proposed in WIRE [11] add new\nmechanisms
    for redirection and resolver delegation to HTTP. While these\nmechanisms are generalized
    to support resolution of all URIs, they were\ndesigned in part to meet the specific
    needs of URN resolution systems.\n \nThis document describes how the WIRE model
    maintains consistency with\nexisting models of URN resolution, how WIRE can be
    used as a URN resolution\nprotocol, and how WIRE fits into the existing URN resolution
    infrastructure,\nincluding NAPTR [8] and THTTP [9].\n\n\t "

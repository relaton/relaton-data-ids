  content: "OSPF requires a router to recalculate its routing table whenever it\nreceives
    a new router or network LSA.  However, a topology change,\nsuch as a router down
    event, may cause a number of new LSAs to be\ngenerated.  These LSAs may arrive
    at a router at different times.  In\norder to avoid several routing table calculations
    in quick succession\nin such cases, commercial routers enforce a hold time between\nsuccessive
    routing table calculations.  The hold time based schemes,\nwhile limiting the
    number of routing table calculations, may also\ncause undesirable delays in convergence
    to the topology change.  This\nID describes an alternate approach to schedule
    routing table\ncalculations, called LSA Correlation.  Rather than using individual\nLSAs
    as triggers for routing table calculations, LSA Correlation\nscheme correlates
    the information in the LSAs to identify the\ntopology change.  A routing table
    calculation can be performed when\nthe topology change has been identified, which
    could span multiple\nLSAs.\n\t "

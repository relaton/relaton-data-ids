  content: "   This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal\n
    \  to its neighbors that it is restarting, allowing them to reestablish\n   their
    adjacencies without cycling through the down state, while still\n   correctly
    initiating database synchronization.\n\n   This document additionally describes
    a mechansim for a router to\n   signal its neighbors that it is preparing to initiate
    a restart while\n   maintaining forwarding plane state.  This allows the neighbors
    to\n   maintain their adjacencies until the router has restarted, but also\n   allows
    the neighbors to bring the adjacencies down in the event of\n   other topology
    changes.\n\n   This document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting\n
    \  router to determine when it has achieved Link State Protocol Data\n   Unit
    (LSP) database synchronization with its neighbors and a\n   mechanism to optimize
    LSP database synchronization, while minimizing\n   transient routing disruption
    when a router starts.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 5306.\n\n\n\t "

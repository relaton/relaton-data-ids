  content: "This document defines a slightly modified Return Routability Test \n(RRT)
    for MIPv6 [RFC3775]. The herein defined RRT mechanism is \nintended for CoA exchanges
    between the MN and the CN. Once the MN \nand CN find out their peers' valid addresses,
    an additional \nmechanism, defined in [I-D.tschofenig-mip6-ice], will be used
    to run \nconnectivity checks to figure out which of the address pairs have \nconnectivity
    and, if needed, open the required pinholes in the \nfirewalls as described in
    [4]. \nThe defined mechanism is intended to work with current firewalls \nwithout
    requiring any support from them.\n\t "

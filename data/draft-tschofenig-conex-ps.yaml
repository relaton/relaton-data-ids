  content: "The increasingly ubiquitous availability of broadband, together with\nflat-rate
    pricing, have made for increasing congestion problems on\nthe network, which are
    often caused by a small number of users\nconsuming a large amount of bandwidth.
    \ In some cases, building out\nmore capacity to handle this new congestion may
    be infeasible or\nunwarranted.  As a result, network operators have sought other
    ways\nto manage congestion both from their own users and from other\nnetworks.
    \ These different types of solutions have different\nstrengths and weaknesses,
    but all of them are limited in a number of\nkey ways.\n\nThis document discusses
    the problems created for operators by high-\nconsuming users and describes the
    strengths and weaknesses of a\nnumber of techniques operators are currently using
    to cope with high\nbandwidth usage.  The discussion of these solutions ultimately
    points\nto a need for a new kind of congestion accounting.\n\t "

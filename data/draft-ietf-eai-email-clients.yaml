  content: "   This document provides some guidelines for email clients that support\n
    \  Email Address Internationalization (EAI) as outlined in [RFC6530].  A\n   number
    of interoperability cases between different versions of email\n   components are
    reviewed.  Recommendations are made to improve\n   interoperability and usability
    and to minimize discrepancies between\n   the display of composed and received
    email in different language\n   environments.\n\n\t "

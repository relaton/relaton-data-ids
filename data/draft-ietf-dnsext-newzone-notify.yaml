  content: "This memo describes the NEWZONE_NOTIFY opcode for DNS, by which a \nprimary
    master server advises a set of slave servers that there is a \nzone has been created
    and that a query should be initiated to \ndiscover the new zone data.\n\nThis
    draft also specifies a mechanism for the slave servers to \nachieve authenticated
    synchronization of zone data as well as zone \nsynchronization information with
    the primary when a zone is created \non the primary.\n\t "

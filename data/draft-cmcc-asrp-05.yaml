  content: "   This document describes an experimental protocol named the Available\n
    \  Session Recovery Protocol (ASRP).  The protocol is designed to\n   optimize
    high-availability network cluster architectures, providing a\n   superior high-availability
    solution for clusters offering stateful\n   network services such as load balancing
    and Network Address\n   Translation (NAT [RFC4787]).  ASRP defines the procedures
    for session\n   backup and recovery, as well as the message formats used during
    these\n   interactions, enabling efficient and streamlined session state\n   management.\n\n
    \  In contrast to traditional high-availability techniques that back up\n   session
    state within the cluster itself, the core innovation of ASRP\n   lies in its distributed
    backup of state information to the client or\n   server side.  This approach offers
    multiple advantages: it\n   significantly enhances the cluster's elastic scaling
    capabilities;\n   supports rapid recovery from single-point or even multi-point\n
    \  failures; reduces resource redundancy by eliminating centralized\n   backup
    nodes; and substantially simplifies the implementation\n   complexity of the cluster.\n\n
    \  The ASRP protocol provides exceptional elastic scalability for\n   network
    clusters, facilitating the implementation and deployment of\n   large-scale elastic
    network clusters.\n\n\t "

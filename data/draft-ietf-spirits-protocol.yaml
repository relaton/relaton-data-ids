  content: "This document describes the Services in PSTN (Public Switched Telephone
    Network) requesting Internet Services (SPIRITS) protocol.  The purpose of the
    SPIRITS protocol is to support services that originate in the cellular or wireline
    PSTN and necessitate interactions between the PSTN and the Internet.  On the PSTN
    side, the SPIRITS services are most often initiated from the Intelligent Network
    (IN) entities.  Internet Call Waiting and Internet Caller-ID Delivery are examples
    of SPIRITS services, as are location-based services on the cellular network.  The
    protocol defines the building blocks from which many other services can be built.

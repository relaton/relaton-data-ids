  content: "   Outbound IP spoofing, where attackers send packets with forged source\n
    \  IP addresses, poses a significant threat to Internet security.\n   Measuring
    the deployment of outbound source address validation (OSAV)\n   is critical for
    characterizing the vulnerability to outbound IP\n   spoofing across the global
    Internet.  Remote measurement of OSAV\n   deployment offers a practical method
    for measuring numerous\n   Autonomous Systems (ASes) efficiently.  This document
    presents a\n   method for remotely measuring the deployment status of OSAV, without\n
    \  cooperations from volunteers in remote networks.\n\n\t "

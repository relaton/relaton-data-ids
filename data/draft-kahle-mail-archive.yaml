  content: "This draft proposes a mail header field 'Restrict:' with a defined value
    of 'no-external-archive' that gives information to a receiving mail transport
    agent or mail user agent that this message should not be archived by individuals
    or organizations not associated with the list owner.            With the increasing
    number of search engines that gather information and offer wide access, some writers
    and would like to restrict how their words are distributed.     Mailing lists
    may begin (or have already begun) to be systematically archived for searching
    and historical reference. This draft is designed for mailing lists, but it can
    also be applied to messages in Usenet newsgroups as well.      The legal issues
    around this are deep and difficult, and this draft does not address these legal
    issues. However, it would be useful to respectful mail receivers if there was
    a standard method for mail creators (authors or list owners) to express their
    desires about whether or not their mail can be archived.\n\t "

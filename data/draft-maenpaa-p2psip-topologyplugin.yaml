  content: "REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer signaling\nprotocol
    that can be used to maintain an overlay network, and to\nstore data in and retrieve
    data from the overlay.  This document\ndefines a new topology plug-in for RELOAD
    that is more appropriate\nfor real world large scale overlays.  This topology
    plug-in\nimplements three important functionalities that allow RELOAD to\noperate
    under real world constraints.  First, it includes a load\nbalancing algorithm
    that specifies efficient allocation of load to\ndifferent nodes in the network.
    \ Second, the document describes\nrobust techniques for stabilization of fingers
    and successors and\nspecifies self tuning mechanisms that allow dynamic and automatic\nadjustment
    of parameters needed for these advanced techniques in the\ntopology plug-in.  Finally,
    it specifies a locality aware finger\nselection algorithm that reduces average
    lookup latency.\n\t "

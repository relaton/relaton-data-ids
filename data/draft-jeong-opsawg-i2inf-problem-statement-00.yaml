  content: "   This document specifies the problem statement for Interface to In-\n
    \  Network Functions (I2INF) for a user's services involved in both\n   networks
    and applications.  In-Network Functions (INF) include In-\n   Network Computing
    Functions (INCF) in Network Functions\n   Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN).  They\n   also include In-Network Application Functions (INAF)
    in Internet-of-\n   Things (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and
    Unmanned\n   Aerial Vehicles (UAV).  Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used
    to\n   realize the user's services consisting of a combination of INFs in a\n
    \  target network.  This document analyzes the gap for an IBN-based\n   system
    to perform the user's service and specifies the requirements\n   for the I2INF
    for intelligent service provisioning.\n\n\t "

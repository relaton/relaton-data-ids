  content: "  The Real-Virtual Agent Protocol (RVP) enables seamless coordination\n
    \ between physical entities (robots, IoT devices, manufacturing\n  systems and
    agents) and digital agents (AI systems, software agents,\n  virtual twins) through
    unified composite identity management,\n  physical/social/production relations
    graph-based coordination, and\n  physical constraint integration. Unlike existing
    protocols that\n  assume peer-to-peer digital relationships (A2A for agents, MCP
    for\n  AI tools, ANP for agent networks), RVP unifies physical and digital\n  agents
    communication and achieves physical data loop for online\n  learning for embodied
    agents considering both hierarchical\n  physical/social/production relations and
    physical world constraints.\n  RVP is designed for immediate deployment in modern
    manufacturing,\n  smart cities, autonomous mobility systems, and human-AI\n  collaborative
    environments where non-peer, partially centralized\n  relations and coordination
    is essential for real-world embodied\n  intelligence networks.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Virtual Agent Protocol (RVP) enables seamless coordination
    between physical entities (robots, IoT devices, manufacturing systems and agents)
    and digital agents (AI systems, software agents, virtual twins) through unified
    composite identity management, physical/social/production relations graph-based
    coordination, and physical constraint integration. Unlike existing protocols that
    assume peer-to-peer digital relationships (A2A for agents, MCP for AI tools, ANP
    for agent networks), RVP unifies physical and digital agents communication and
    achieves physical data loop for online learning for embodied agents considering
    both hierarchical physical/social/production relations and physical world constraints.
    RVP is designed for immediate deployment in modern manufacturing, smart cities,
    autonomous mobility systems, and human-AI collaborative environments where non-peer,
    partially centralized relations and coordination is essential for real-world embodied
    intelligence networks.</p>"

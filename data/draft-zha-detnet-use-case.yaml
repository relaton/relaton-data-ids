  content: "   This document describes some high level use cases and scenarios\n   with
    requirements on delay sensitive and deterministic networking.\n   Not only the
    telecom industry but also vertical industries have\n   been investigated. In addition
    to the 5G networking, industrial\n   automation, automotive industry, media and
    gaming industry are\n   typical related industries believed to be representative
    for the\n   technical requirements on ultra-fast and ultra-reliability\n   communications.\n\n\n\n\t "

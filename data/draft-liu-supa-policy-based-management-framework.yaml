  content: "   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines base YANG data\n
    \  models to encode policy, which will point to device-, technology-,\n   and
    service-specific YANG models developed in other working groups.\n   Policy rules
    within an operator's environment can be used to express\n   high-level, possibly
    network-wide policies to a network management\n   function (within a controller,
    an orchestrator, or a network element).\n   The network management function can
    then control the configuration\n   and/or monitoring of network elements and services.
    This document\n   describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements and interfaces.\n\n\t "

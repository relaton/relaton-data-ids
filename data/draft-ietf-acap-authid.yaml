  content: "Most distributed (client/server) applications require an authenti-\ncation
    process between the client and the server before the server\nwill grant access
    to its managed resources.  Many applications pro-\nvide varying levels of access
    to server resources based on a combi-\nnation of authentication credentials and
    access control rules.\nThe collection of information used to control access to
    resources\nis called 'authorization information'.\nThe authorization identifer
    datasets contain lists of users and\ngroups of users that can be used by applications
    for authorization\npurposes.  Access control mechanisms can be abstracted from
    under-\nlying authentication mechanisms and credential formats.  They can\nbe
    extended to include group memberships in dynamic calculations\nfor access rights
    to resources or in definition of one time autho-\nrization certificates.\nThe
    Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) supports the\nremote storage
    and access of many types of structured configuration\ninformation.  The authorization
    identifier datasets specification\ndescribes the 'userid' and 'groupid' datasets
    which contain the\nauthorization information.  It also describes ACAP server capabili-\nties
    that advertise a server's support for authorization user and\ngroup semantics.\n\t "

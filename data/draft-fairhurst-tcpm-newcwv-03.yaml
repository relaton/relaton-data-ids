  content: "   This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used to support\n
    \  variable-rate traffic that exhibits periods where the transmission\n   rate
    is limited by the application rather than the congestion window.\n   It updates
    TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following\n   either an idle or application-limited
    interval.  The method is\n   expected to benefit variable-rate TCP applications,
    while also\n   providing an appropriate response if congestion is experienced.\n\n
    \  It also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation, CWV, an IETF\n   experimental
    specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that\n   CWV sought to address
    important issues, but failed to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This document
    therefore recommends that the\n   IETF should consider moving RFC 2861 from Experimental
    to Historic\n   status, and that this is replaced by the current specification.\n\n\t "

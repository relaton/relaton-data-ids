abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft defines a modification of the use of the SIP protocol to\nperform
    route reservation. These modifications are applied to two of\nthe existing SIP
    Methods: INVITE and REGISTER. The modifications\nallow the INVITE method to be
    used to find the best path across a\nparticular network based on QoS metrics.
    The route choice is able to\nbe restricted at the network edge. The proposed modifications
    also\nallow the REGISTER method to be used as a means of disseminating\ninformation
    necessary to determine these QoS metrics. This\ninformation can be used to route
    INVITEs away from known areas of\ncongestion.\n\t "

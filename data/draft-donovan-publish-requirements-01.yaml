  content: "This document defines the requirements for a proposed extension to\nthe
    Session Initiation Protocol [1].  This extension would provide a\ngeneral-purpose
    mechanism for uploading service related data.  For\ninstance, there is currently
    the need to upload or publish CPL to SIP\nProxies and presence documents to SIP
    Presence Servers.\nThis document does NOT outline an extension to SIP to handle
    these\nrequirements.  The author is attempting to follow the guidelines that\nrequirements
    should be defined and agreed to before work on the an\nextension begins.\n\t "

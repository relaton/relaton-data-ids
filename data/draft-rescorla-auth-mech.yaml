  content: "Authentication is perhaps the most basic security problem for design-\ners
    of network protocols. Even the early Internet protocols such as\nTELNET and FTP,
    which provided no other security services, made pro-\nvision for user authentication.
    Unfortunately, these early authenti-\ncation systems were wholly inadequate for
    the Internet Threat Model\n[REF] and a vast array of other authentication mechanisms
    have been\nintroduced in an attempt to close these holes.\nThe most striking thing
    about these security mechanisms is how many\nof them are essentially similar.
    There are only 7 basic classes of\nauthentication protocol but there are a large
    number of slightly dif-\nferent protocols with essentially the same security properties.
    This\nmemo surveys the space of authentication mechanisms, describes the\nbasic
    classes and provides examples of protocols which fit into each\nclass.\n\t "

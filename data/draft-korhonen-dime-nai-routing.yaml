  content: "This specification clarifies the Diameter realm based request\nrouting.
    \ We focus on the case where a Network Access Identifier in\nthe User-Name AVP
    is used to populate the Destination-Realm AVP and\nthe Network Access Identifier
    contains more than one realm.  This\nparticular case is possible when the Network
    Access Identifier\ndecoration is used to force a routing of request messages through
    a\npredefined list of realms.  However, this functionality is not\nunambiguously
    specified in the Diameter Base Protocol specification.\n\t "

  content: "This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema for reverse
    DNS management in a tightly controlled Representational State Transfer (REST)
    environment.  This document describes a schema that has been developed and deployed
    by ICANN in a \"RESTful\" system since 2011 and is being used by the registries
    responsible for reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
    through an HTTPS transaction that is mediated by an X.509 certificate.\n\t "

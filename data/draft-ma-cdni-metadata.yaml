  content: "   Content publishers (CPs) often use multiple Content Delivery Networks\n
    \  (CDNs) to deliver content to consumers.  Though existing interactions\n   between
    CPs and individual CDNs are beyond the scope of CDN\n   interconnection (CDNI),
    it is important to understand the management\n   capabilities and features available
    with existing non-interconnected\n   multi-CDN deployments.  Before migrating
    to CDNI, CPs must first\n   assess the suitability of CDNI as a replacement for
    their existing\n   non-interconnected multi-CDN deployments.  CDN feature configuration\n
    \  and capability advertisement and enforcement is likely to occur\n   through
    the CDNI metadata interface (MI).  This document describes an\n   approach to
    implementing the CDNI MI through the use of an extensible\n   metadata model and
    a light-weight HTTP-based API.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Many services that SIP is anticipated to support require the ability \nto
    determine why and how the call arrived at a specific application.  \nExamples
    of such services include (but are not limited to) sessions \ninitiated to call
    centers via 'click to talk' SIP URLs on a web page, \n'call history/logging' style
    services within intelligent 'call \nmanagement' software for SIP UAs and calls
    to voicemail servers and \ncall centers.  While SIP implicitly provides the redirect/retarget
    \ncapabilities that enable calls to be routed to chosen applications, \nthere
    is currently no standard mechanism within SIP for communicating \nthe history
    of such a request. This 'request history' information \nallows the receiving application
    to determine hints about how and why \nthe call arrived at the application/user.
    \    \nThis draft discusses the motivations in support of a mechanism for \nrecording
    the 'request history', and proposes detailed requirements \nfor such a generic
    'request history' capability.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There can be typical M2M scenarios where responses from the data\n
    \  sink to the data source against request/ notification from the\n   source might
    be considered redundant. This kind of open-loop\n   exchange (with no reverse
    path from the sink to the source) may be\n   desired while updating resources
    or notifying about the updated\n   status of a resource in constrained systems
    looking for maximized\n   throughput with minimized resource consumption. CoAP
    already\n   provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of exchange where The\n   receiving
    end-point does not respond with ACK. However, the\n   receiving end-point responds
    the sender with a status code\n   indicating \"the result of the attempt to understand
    and satisfy the\n   request\".\n\n   This draft introduces a header option: 'No-Resp'
    to suppress\n   responses from the receiver and discusses exemplary use cases
    which\n   motivated this proposition based on real experience. This option\n   also
    provides granularity by allowing suppression of a particular\n   class or a combination
    of classes of responses. This option is\n   applicable for both request/ response
    as well as resource-observe\n   mode and may be effective for both unicast and
    multicast scenarios.\n\n\t "

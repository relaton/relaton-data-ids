  content: "This draft proposes crankback routing extensions for CR-LDP\nsignaling.
    \ Recently, several routing protocol extensions for\nadvertising resource information
    in addition to topology information\nhave been proposed for use in distributed
    constraint-based routing.\nIn such a distributed routing environment, however,
    the information\nused to compute a constraint-based path may be out of date. This\nmeans
    that label requests may be blocked by links or nodes without\nsufficient resources.
    This draft specifies crankback routing\nextensions for CR-LDP so that the label
    request can be retried on an\nalternate path that detours around the blocked link
    or node upon a\nsetup failure. Furthermore, the proposed crankback routing schemes\ncan
    be also applied to end-to-end LSP restoration by indicating the\nlocation of the
    failure link or node. This would significantly\nimprove the recovery ratio for
    failed LSPs, especially in situations\nwhere a large number of setup requests
    are triggered at the same\ntime.\n\t "

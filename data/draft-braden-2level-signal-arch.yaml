  content: "This memo defines an architectural framework for a wide variety of\nInternet
    signaling protocols.  This framework has a two-level\norganization: a common lower
    layer 'transport' protocol together with\na suite of upper-level signaling protocols.
    \ The common lower level\nprotocol CSTP (Common Signaling Transport Protocol)
    provides a\ntransport-like service that may include reliable delivery and soft\nstate
    management.  The upper layer protocols, which implement\nalgorithms and data structures
    specific to particular signaling\napplications, are generically called ULSPs (Upper-layer
    Signaling\nProtocols).  This memo motivates the two-level design and describes\nthe
    service model, API, and operation of the lower level CSTP.\n\t "

  content: "   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different\n   applications
    while maximizing network resources usage, there's\n   growing business pressure
    to minimize operational tasks and the\n   deployment time of new services.\n\n
    \  New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals,\n   including
    the optimization of network functions through application\n   control.  This control
    could be signaled directly by an application,\n   through a proxy or orchestrated
    in a centralized manner.\n\n   The current version of the Application-based Policy
    for Network\n   Functions (APONF) proposed working group mentions the NSIS framework\n
    \  as a possible signaling protocol, through the definition of a new\n   NSIS
    Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).  The present memo analyses if\n   this proposition
    is suitable for the designed purpose and if other\n   protocols would be more
    suitable.\n\n\t "

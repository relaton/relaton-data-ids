  content: "The contents of this Internet Draft is a reprint of the body of the\narchitecture
    document (DTS 02003 v0.10.8) of the TIPHON project.\nThis document describes a
    functional architecture for the purposes\nof defining a voice over IP architecture
    that can interwork with the\nexisting Switched Circuit Networks (SCN).\nThe full
    document is publicly available and can be found at\nhttp://docbox.etsi.org/Tech-Org/TIPHON/Document/tiphon/07-\ndrafts/wg2/DTS02003/
    the current version is 0.10.8. Later versions\nwill appear in the same directory.
    This full document describes\nprotocol independent information flows and state
    diagrams on all the\nreference points.\nThe next step in the TIPHON process will
    be the mapping of the\nreference points as defined in this document to existing
    standards.\nSince TIPHON does not intend to duplicate work so the project would\nappreciate
    assistance from IETF experts in the mapping of its\ninformation flows to the appropriate
    IETF protocols. Candidate\nprotocols for the implementation of this architecture
    are SIP,\nMEGACOp and possibly others.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses technical issues and requirements for the\nmanagement
    information base (MIB) for Fibre Channel and storage\nnetwork applications.  This
    document is likely to be expanded to\ninclude management of specific Fibre Channel
    device types in the\nfuture. The purpose is to have an overall structure and view
    of\nFibre Channel MIBs for consistency and interoperability. This\ndocument does
    not try to cover the details of each individual MIB.\nThis is an initial draft
    document, which will evolve and expand\nover time. It is the intent of this document
    to produce a coherent\ndescription of a framework for various MIB development
    which was\nand is being considered by the working group.  Selection of\nspecific
    approaches, making choices regarding engineering tradeoffs,\nand detailed protocol
    specification, are outside of the scope of\nthis framework document.\n\t "

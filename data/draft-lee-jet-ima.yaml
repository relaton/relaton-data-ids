  content: "An email address has two parts - local part and domain part - \nseparated
    by \"@\" sign. This document describes a basic solution to \ninternationalized
    email address (IMA) and includes some preliminary \nsurvey results. The proposed
    solution enables SMTP servers to support \nIMA. The solution discussed in this
    document is immediately \ndeployable by interested parties without affecting or
    breaking any \nother existing systems. \n\t "

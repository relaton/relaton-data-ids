- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 3552 is a useful analysis and presentation of recommendations for\n
    \  Security Considerations Sections.  Part of its content is an\n   extensive
    analysis of, and proposed replacement for, the Security\n   Considerations section
    of RFC 2821.  In important respects, the\n   proposed replacement text may not
    be appropriate for this type of\n   document.  It also raises some specific issues
    that may not be\n   consistent with the consensus community of email experts about
    best\n   practice.  Given the way it is worded, and the fact that it was\n   published
    as a BCP document, it is plausible to consider it as an\n   Update to RFC 2821
    and to consider its \"example\" to be normative for\n   any future revision of
    RFC 2821 such as the work that has been\n   started in [7].  Those perceptions
    should be definitively evaluated\n   and corrected if necessary.  This document
    is a first step in doing\n   so and also makes some specific additional suggestions
    about the\n   handling of Security Considerations material.\n\t "

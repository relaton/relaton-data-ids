  content: "   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol allows authorized non-\n
    \  members to join a group via external commits, however it disallows\n   most
    pending proposals in those commits, which causes unfortunate\n   side effects.
    \ This document describes an MLS extension to include\n   pending proposal in
    external commits when the extension is present in\n   a group.\n\n\t "

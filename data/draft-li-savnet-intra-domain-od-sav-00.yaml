  content: "   Source Address Validation (SAV) mechanisms, such as unicast Reverse\n
    \  Path Forwarding (uRPF), Access Control Lists (ACLs), and Best-Match\n   Shortest
    Path Filtering (BM-SPF), are widely deployed to prevent IP\n   source address
    spoofing.  However, these mechanisms are typically\n   designed for static routing
    scenarios and deployed at fixed network\n   boundaries.\n\n   With the increasing
    adoption of dynamic forwarding technologies such\n   as SRv6 Policy and Fast Reroute
    (TI-FRR), the network's actual\n   forwarding path may change frequently due to
    policy-based traffic\n   steering or link failures.  In such cases, statically
    deployed SAV\n   rules may fail to validate traffic on newly activated or alternate\n
    \  paths, creating validation blind spots or even leading to false\n   positives
    that block legitimate traffic.\n\n   This draft proposes an On-Demand Source Address
    Validation Activation\n   mechanism.  It enables routers to dynamically activate
    or update SAV\n   rules on specific interfaces only when the interface becomes
    part of\n   an active forwarding path due to policy or failover triggers.  This\n
    \  approach enhances SAV coverage, avoids unnecessary resource\n   consumption,
    and ensures SAV correctness under dynamic path switching\n   scenarios driven
    by SRv6-policy and TI-FRR.\n\n\t "

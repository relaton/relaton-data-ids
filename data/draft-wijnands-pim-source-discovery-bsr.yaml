- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   PIM Sparse-Mode uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) and shared trees to\n
    \  forward multicast packets to Last Hop Routers (LHR).  After the first\n   packet
    is received by the LHR, the source of the multicast stream is\n   learned and
    the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) can be joined.  This draft\n   proposes a solution
    to support PIM Sparse Mode (SM) without the need\n   for PIM registers, RPs or
    shared trees.  Multicast source information\n   is flooded throughout the multicast
    domain using a new generic PIM\n   flooding mechanism.  This mechanism is defined
    in this document, and\n   is modeled after the PIM Bootstrap Router protocol.
    \ By removing the\n   need for RPs and shared trees, the PIM-SM procedures are
    simplified,\n   improving router operations, management and making the protocol
    more\n   robust.\n\n\t "

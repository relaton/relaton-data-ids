  content: "This document defines algorithms for Authenticated Encryption with Associated
    Data (AEAD), and defines a uniform interface and a registry for such algorithms.
    \ The interface and registry can be used as an application-independent set of
    cryptoalgorithm suites.  This approach provides advantages in efficiency and security,
    and promotes the reuse of crypto implementations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

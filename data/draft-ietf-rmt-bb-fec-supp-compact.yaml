  content: "This document introduces some Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes that
    supplement the FEC schemes described in RFC 3452.  The primary benefits of these
    additional FEC schemes are that they are designed for reliable bulk delivery of
    large objects using a more compact FEC Payload ID, and they can be used to sequentially
    deliver blocks of an object of indeterminate length.  Thus, they more flexibly
    support different delivery models with less packet header overhead.  This document
    also describes the Fully-Specified FEC scheme corresponding to FEC Encoding ID
    0.  This Fully-Specified FEC scheme requires no FEC coding and is introduced primarily
    to allow simple interoperability testing between different implementations of
    protocol instantiations that use the FEC building block.  This memo defines an
    Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

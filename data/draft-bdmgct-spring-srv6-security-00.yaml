  script: Latn
  content: "   SRv6 is a traffic engineering, encapsulation, and steering mechanism\n
    \  utilizing IPv6 addresses to identify segments in a pre-defined\n   policy.
    \ While SRv6 uses what appear to be typical IPv6 addresses,\n   the address space
    is treated differently, and in most (all?) cases.\n\n   A typical IPv6 unicast
    address is comprised of a network prefix, host\n   identifier, and a subnet mask.
    \ A typical SRv6 segment identifier\n   (SID) is broken into a locator, a function
    identifier, and\n   optionally, function arguments.  The locator must be routable,
    which\n   enables both SRv6 capable and incapable devices to participate in\n
    \  forwarding, either as normal IPv6 unicast or SRv6.  The capability to\n   operate
    in environments that may have gaps in SRv6 support allows the\n   bridging of
    islands of SRv6 devices with standard IPv6 unicast\n   routing.\n\n   As standard
    IPv6 addressing, there are security considerations that\n   should be well understood
    that may not be obvious.\n\n\t "

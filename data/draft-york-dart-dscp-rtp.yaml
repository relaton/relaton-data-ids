  content: "   This document describes the interaction between Differentiated\n   Services
    (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality\n   and real-time network
    communication, including communication based on\n   the Real-time Transport Protocol
    (RTP).  DiffServ is based on network\n   nodes applying different forwarding treatments
    to packets whose IP\n   headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points
    (DSCPs).  As a\n   result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream
    may\n   cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., reordering).  In\n   addition,
    DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic\n   source and destination.
    \ This document covers the implications of\n   these DiffServ aspects for real-time
    network communication, including\n   RTCWEB.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a number of response\n
    \  codes which a SIP agent can use to indicate that it cannot find a\n   suitable
    destination to which to send a request.  Unfortunately, this\n   set of response
    codes was not carefully designed, making it difficult\n   in many cases for a
    proxy to select a response code that accurately\n   reflects the proxy's knowledge
    about the request URI.  This document\n   describes these response codes and their
    current usage.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses the general problem of routing in an IPv6\n
    \  Nested Virtual Private Network.  A solution is proposed based on one-\n   way
    hashes of IP Prefix values.  The concepts extend to IPv4, but\n   with difficulty
    due to the number of bits in question.\n\t "

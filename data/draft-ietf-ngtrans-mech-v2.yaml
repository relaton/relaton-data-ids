  content: "This document specifies IPv4 compatibility mechanisms that can be\nimplemented
    by IPv6 hosts and routers.  These mechanisms include\nproviding complete implementations
    of both versions of the Internet\nProtocol (IPv4 and IPv6), and tunneling IPv6
    packets over IPv4\nrouting infrastructures.  They are designed to allow IPv6 nodes
    to\nmaintain complete compatibility with IPv4, which should greatly\nsimplify
    the deployment of IPv6 in the Internet, and facilitate the\neventual transition
    of the entire Internet to IPv6.\n\t "

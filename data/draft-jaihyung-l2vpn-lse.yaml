  content: "LSE (Label Switched Ethernet) is a label switching technique for\ntransmission
    of Ethernet frame. The method offers not only L2VPN\nconnectivity but it also
    provides features for dynamic connection\nestablishment and resource reservation.
    LSE does not require\nadditional information fields other than 802.3 standard
    header\nbecause it uses destination address and source address as labels. As\na
    result, compatibility with legacy Ethernet is maintained and it\nprovides label
    switching service from terminal to terminal.\nEquipments that support LSE are
    connected via Ethernet tunnel merging\ntree or TLSP (Tunnel LSP) tree across legacy
    network equipment. User\nterminals establish connections using modified ARP protocol.
    Use of\nmerging tree structure helps reducing signaling overhead as well as\nimproving
    scalability of LSE network. LSE also provides unified\nmechanism for unicasting,
    multicasting and wireless terminal mobility.\n\t "

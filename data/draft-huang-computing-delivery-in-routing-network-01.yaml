  content: "   This document drafts a proposal of the architecture of Computing\n
    \  Delivery in Routing Network which incorporates both computing and\n   networking
    metrics into the routing polices and enables the network\n   sensing and scheduling
    computing services based upon traditional\n   networking services.  A mechanism
    of two-class computing status\n   granularity and two segment routing is illustrated
    for end-to-end\n   networking and computing service in the cloud sites, while
    major\n   networking and computing actors is defined in terms of functionality.\n
    \  An example work flow is demonstrated, and both control plane and data\n   plane
    solution consideration is proposed..\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document drafts a proposal of the architecture of Computing Delivery
    in Routing Network which incorporates both computing and networking metrics into
    the routing polices and enables the network sensing and scheduling computing services
    based upon traditional networking services. A mechanism of two-class computing
    status granularity and two segment routing is illustrated for end-to-end networking
    and computing service in the cloud sites, while major networking and computing
    actors is defined in terms of functionality. An example work flow is demonstrated,
    and both control plane and data plane solution consideration is proposed..</p>"

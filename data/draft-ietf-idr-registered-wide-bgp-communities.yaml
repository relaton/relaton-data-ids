  content: "   Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays an\n
    \  important role in external BGP [RFC4271] peering relations.  The most\n   common
    tool used today to attach various information about routes is\n   realized with
    the use of BGP communities [RFC1997].  Such information\n   is important for the
    peering AS to perform some mutually agreed\n   actions without the need to maintain
    a separate offline database for\n   each pair of prefix and an associated with
    it requested set of action\n   entries.\n\n   This document proposes to establish
    a new IANA maintained registry of\n   most commonly used Wide BGP Communities
    by network operators.  Such\n   public registry will allow for easy refernece
    and clear\n   interpretation of the actions associated with received community\n
    \  values.\n\n\n\t "

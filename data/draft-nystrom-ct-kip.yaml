  content: "This document constitutes Revision 1 of Cryptographic Token Key Initialization
    Protocol (CT-KIP) Version 1.0 from RSA Laboratories' One-Time Password Specifications
    (OTPS) series. The body of this document, except for the intellectual property
    considerations section, is taken from the CT-KIP Version 1.0 document, but comments
    received during the IETF review are reflected; hence, the status of a revised
    version. As no \"bits-on-the-wire\" have changed, the protocol specified herein
    is compatible with CT-KIP Version 1.0.\n\n CT-KIP is a client-server protocol
    for initialization (and configuration) of cryptographic tokens. The protocol requires
    neither private-key capabilities in the cryptographic tokens, nor an established
    public-key infrastructure. Provisioned (or generated) secrets will only be available
    to the server and the cryptographic token itself. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

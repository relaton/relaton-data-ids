  content: "   Tapping  technologies  provide  traffic  visibility  to  network\n
    \  analysis tools such as monitors, traffic recorders and security\n   systems.
    Current tapping architectures and protocols are vendor\n   specific and adapted
    to legacy networks.\n\n   Emerging networking such as large scale datacenters
    for cloud\n   applications and Mobile backhaul networks demand accurate and fast\n
    \  network traffic visibility. These networks are built on Layer 2\n   technologies
    \ and  infrastructure  to  support  virtual  machines\n   mobility, growing number
    of devices including mobile users.\n\n   SmarTap architecture is designed to support
    emerging network\n   requirements  allowing  network  analysis  tools  to  gain
    \ full\n   visibility of network traffic. SmarTap technology monitors each\n   link
    and each component of the network. It captures packets,\n   classifies them and
    sends them to tools with relevant packet\n   attributes.  SmarTap  can  provide
    \ attributes  such  as  flow-ID,\n   tapping-location, tapping-time and statistics.\n\n\t "

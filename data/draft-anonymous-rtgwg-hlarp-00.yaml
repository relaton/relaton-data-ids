  content: "   This internet-draft describes a protocol with an addressing scheme\n
    \  where members of the internet are addressed by their physical\n   addresses
    and by an implementing internet router that can contact\n   them.  The packets
    sent by the protocol include handshake messages,\n   client data, and the status
    of the data being sent.  A routing\n   procedure is suggested according to special
    addresses that carry\n   information about the region of a router.\n\n\t "

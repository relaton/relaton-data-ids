  content: "This document specifies Echo protocol, that was firstly defined in\nRFC
    862.  However that document does not match current Internet\nStandards and specifies
    Echo protocol for TCP and UDP only, while a\nnumber of other transport-layer protocols
    have appeared since the\ntime of publication of RFC 862. \n\nThis document aligns
    Echo protocol specification with the current\nInternet Standards and specifies
    Echo protocol for the most wide-\nspread transport-layer protocols.  It obsoletes
    RFC 347 and RFC 862\nand moves the last to Historic status.\n\t "

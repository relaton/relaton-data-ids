    of ISO 7812 financial transaction identification card (i.e.,\ncredit/debit card)
    numbers and ISO 7816 smart card or related numbers\nmay need to locate on the
    Internet. For example, some systems assume\na smart card holder can contact the
    issuer of a smart card\napplication for maintenance and update functions and the
    payment\nprotocols may assume that a card holder can locate the appropriate\ncertification
    authority to obtain a card holder certificate. This\ndocument specifies a method
    using the DNS as an important element in\nlocating card related facilities on
    the Internet by mapping ISO 7812\nand ISO 7816 number systems into domain names.\n\n\t "

  content: "At the 51st IETF meeting in London, there was much disagreement in \nthe
    MIDCOM working group about the need for topology information in \nthe MIDCOM requirements.
    It was decided that there should be a \n'contest of champions' in which interested
    parties write drafts \ndescribing their solution to the problem. \nThis document
    presents a proposal for the inclusion of minimal \ntopological information in
    the MIDCOM protocol by the use of \nabstract realms.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a standardized protocol for *discovery and\n
    \  invocation of AI agents* over HTTP.  It defines a common metadata\n   format
    for describing AI agents (including capabilities, I/O\n   specifications, supported
    languages, tags, authentication methods,\n   etc.), a semantic search mechanism
    to discover and match agents based\n   on capabilities, and a unified RESTful
    invocation interface for\n   calling those agents.  The goal is to enable cross-platform\n
    \  interoperability among AI agents by providing a *“discover and\n   match”*
    mechanism and a *unified invocation entry point* via standard\n   HTTP.  Security
    considerations, including authentication and trust\n   measures, are also discussed.
    \ This specification aims to facilitate\n   the formation of multi-agent systems
    by making it easy to find the\n   right agent for a task and invoke it in a consistent
    manner across\n   different vendors and platforms.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a standardized protocol for discovery and invocation
    of AI agents. It defines a common metadata format for describing AI agents (including
    capabilities, I/O specifications, supported languages, tags, authentication methods,
    etc.), a capability-based discovery mechanism, and a unified RESTful invocation
    interface. This revision additionally specifies an optional extension that enables
    intent-based agent selection prior to discovery and invocation, without changing
    existing discovery or invocation semantics. The goal is to enable cross-platform
    interoperability among AI agents by providing a discover-and-match mechanism and
    a unified invocation entry point. Security considerations, including authentication
    and trust measures, are also discussed. This specification aims to facilitate
    the formation of multi-agent systems by making it easy to find the right agent
    for a task and invoke it in a consistent manner across different vendors and platforms.</p>"

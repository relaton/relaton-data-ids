  content: "  This Internet Draft describes a method of using MPLS to realize\n  a
    provider IP VPN capability. The approach described here\n  exploits the Label
    Switch Path (LSP) mesh implicitly established\n  between all edge routers in an
    MPLS domain [4]. It uses 2 levels\n  of LSP tunneling. The outer or base level
    is the hop by hop LSP\n  tunnels that interconnect all VPN Border (Label Switch)
    Routers\n  (VBR\\022s). The 'bottom of label stack', nested level provides\n  logically
    single hop tunnels between VBR\\022s. For each IP VPN,\n  single hop nested tunnels
    are established between all VBR's\n  serving that particular VPN. The draft outlines
    the components\n  involved in the MPLS IP VPN architecture and outlines how they\n
    \ interact. The proposed realization is caste in terms of the VPN\n  areas introduced
    in [1] and is geared to take advantage of a\n  virtual router (VR) capability
    in the VBR's. This results in a\n  powerful and flexible method of providing an
    IP VPN service that\n  meets the requirements outlined in [3]. Also described
    are two\n  extensions: offering MPLS VPN service to the customer (rather\n  than
    IP service) and using Label Switching to traverse VPN\n  areas[1].\n\n\t "

  content: "   Transport networks that provide connectivity and bandwidth for\n   customer
    services have typically been static, lacking\n   flexibility, and requiring long
    planning times when deploying new\n   services. Network Providers and Service
    Providers have embraced\n   technologies that allow separation of data plane and
    control plane,\n   distributed signaling for path setup and protection, and centralized\n
    \  path computation for service planning and traffic engineering.\n   Although
    these technologies provide significant benefits, they do\n   not meet the growing
    need for network programmability, automation,\n   resource sharing, and service
    elasticity necessary to meet\n   operators' requirements for virtual network operation.\n\n
    \  Virtual network operation refers to the creation of a\n   virtualized environment
    allowing operators to view the\n   abstraction of the underlying multi-administration,
    multi-\n   vendor, multi-technology networks and to operate, control, and\n   manage
    these multiple networks as if a single virtualized network.\n   Another dimension
    of virtual network operation is the use of\n   common core transport network resources
    by multi-tenant service\n   networks as a way of providing a virtualized infrastructure
    to\n   flexibly offer new services and applications.\n\n   The work effort investigating
    this problem space is known as\n   Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks
    (ACTN). This\n   document provides an ACTN problem description, a scope of work,\n
    \  and outlines the core objectives and requirements to facilitate\n   virtual
    network operation.\n\n\n\t "

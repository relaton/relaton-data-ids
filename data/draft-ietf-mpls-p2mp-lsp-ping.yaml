  content: "Recent proposals have extended the scope of Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) to encompass point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.\n\n
    The requirement for a simple and efficient mechanism that can be used to detect
    data-plane failures in point-to-point (P2P) MPLS LSPs has been recognized and
    has led to the development of techniques for fault detection and isolation commonly
    referred to as \"LSP ping\".\n\n The scope of this document is fault detection
    and isolation for P2MP MPLS LSPs. This documents does not replace any of the mechanisms
    of LSP ping, but clarifies their applicability to MPLS P2MP LSPs, and extends
    the techniques and mechanisms of LSP ping to the MPLS P2MP environment.\n\n This
    document updates RFC 4379. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

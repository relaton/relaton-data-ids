  content: "This document defines a classification of Mail Based Servers (MBSs) based
    on their behaviour towards their users. The most important distinction is between
    mail responders (e.g. echo servers, file servers) and mail forwarders (e.g. mailing
    lists, auto-forwarders). The document aims at a global understanding of these
    MBS classes and other common MBS attributes, such as roles (administrators, owners),
    MBS lifetime and restricted MBS use.\n\t "

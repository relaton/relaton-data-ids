  content: "   This document describes a revised model for the management, evolution\n
    \  and improvement of the RFC Series led by an RFC Series Editor (RSE)\n   assisted
    by an RFC Series Editorial Board (RSEB).  The model removes\n   the IAB and its
    appointed RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) from\n   direct control of the
    RFC Series and the RFC Series Editor, replacing\n   them on the publication evolution
    side with the RSEB, and on the\n   financial and personnel management side with
    the IETF Administration\n   Limited Liability Company or its board as appropriate
    (LLC).\n\n\t "

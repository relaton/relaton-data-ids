  content: "   This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane\n   encapsulation
    solutions.  The described data plane solutions can be\n   applied over either
    IP or MPLS Packet Switched Networks.\n\n   Comment #1:  SB> An overarching comment
    is that the early part of the\n     document is really fundamental architecture
    and perhaps belongs in\n     the arch draft, leaving this draft to be more specific
    about\n     solutions.  Indeed if we cannot find a single solution that maps to\n
    \    both IP and MPLS underlays I wonder if we should publish two\n     specialist
    RFCs?\n\n   Discussion:  One document at the beginning, split into two if/when\n
    \    needed.  Would be post adoption in any case.\n\n   Comment #2:  SB> Whilst
    I think we should look for a common solution\n     to IP and MPLS I do not think
    that this is where the DT ended up.\n\n   Discussion:  Agree.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft proposes a PMIP-based routing optimization method in\n   distributed
    anchor architecture.  The anchor of the mobile node is\n   able to communicate
    with the anchor of corresponding node directly\n   using optimized routing.  In
    this draft, there are two modes for the\n   setup of routing optimization: the
    direct mode and the relay mode.\n   The difference between them lies in that whether
    the routing\n   optimization is set up directly or under the assistance of a third\n
    \  anchor.  The situation that Communication Node(CN) is a fixed\n   terminal
    or a content server is also considered and 3 solutions are\n   provided correspondingly.
    \ The method proposed in this draft can\n   reduce the delay and save signaling
    overhead in the current scheme.\n\n\t "

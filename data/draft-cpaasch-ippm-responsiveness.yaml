  content: "   For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called lag,\n   latency,
    or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but\n   common symptom
    in today's networks.  Even after a decade of work on\n   standardizing technical
    solutions, it remains a common problem for\n   the end users.\n\n   Everyone \"knows\"
    that it is \"normal\" for a video conference to have\n   problems when somebody
    else at home is watching a 4K movie or\n   uploading photos from their phone.
    \ However, there is no technical\n   reason for this to be the case.  In fact,
    various queue management\n   solutions (fq_codel, cake, PIE) have solved the problem
    for tens of\n   thousands of people.\n\n   Our networks remain unresponsive, not
    from a lack of technical\n   solutions, but rather a lack of awareness of the
    problem.  We believe\n   that creating a tool whose measurement matches people's
    every day\n   experience will create the necessary awareness, and result in a\n
    \  demand for products that solve the problem.\n\n   This document specifies the
    \"RPM Test\" for measuring responsiveness.\n   It uses common protocols and mechanisms
    to measure user experience\n   especially when the network is fully loaded (\"responsiveness
    under\n   working conditions\".)  The measurement is expressed as \"Round-trips\n
    \  Per Minute\" (RPM) and should be included with throughput (up and\n   down)
    and idle latency as critical indicators of network quality.\n\n\t "

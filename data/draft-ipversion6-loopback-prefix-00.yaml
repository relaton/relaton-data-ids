  content: "    The IPv6 address range of 0::/64 is reserved for loopback addresses.\n
    \   This expands from the single loophack address already defined for IPv6,\n
    \   ::1, to allow for a set of addresses to be used when packets are intended\n
    \   to stay within a host system.  Multiple loopback addresses allow for\n    simultaneous
    varied uses of the loopback addresses as has proven, albeit\n    in limited ways,
    in IPv4.  And exception is made to accomodate the\n    ::0/128, already defined
    as The Unspecified Address.\n\n\t "

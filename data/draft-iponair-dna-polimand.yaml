  content: "  A handover is the process during which a mobile node is handed over
    \n  between access networks. Especially for vertical handovers in overlay \n  networks
    the mobile node changes the access network using multiple \n  interfaces including
    different link layers, e.g., WLAN, GPRS, and \n  UMTS. Handovers occur as a consequence
    of lower layer (i.e., link-\n  layer) handovers that signify a switch of the physical
    connection to \n  a new location. For the duration of a handover, a mobile node
    is \n  unable to send or receive traffic. The length of this disruption is \n
    \ considered critical because it affects the performance of the \n  communication.
    An additional factor is the link layer selection. It \n  implies the selection
    of the most suitable link layer from which a \n  mobile node should receive services.

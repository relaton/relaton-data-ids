  content: "   This document specifies a scalable approach to name-based packet\n
    \  forwarding, a fundamental component of content semantic network\n   architectures.
    \ Unlike IP-based forwarding, name-based forwarding\n   must address the challenges
    of handling variable-length, unbounded\n   keys and significantly larger namespaces.
    \ The proposed approach\n   leverages two key insights to enable scalable forwarding
    for billions\n   of prefixes.  First, by representing names as binary strings,\n
    \  forwarding tables with millions of entries can be effectively\n   compressed
    using Patricia tries to fit within contemporary line card\n   memory.  Second,
    the data structure is designed and optimized to\n   ensure its size is dependent
    only on the number of rules, not the\n   length of the rules themselves.\n\n\t "

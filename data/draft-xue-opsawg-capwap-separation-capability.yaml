  content: "   In centralized IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)\n   architecture,
    the Access Controller (AC) isn't intelligent enough\n   actually to aggregate
    all the wireless frames, even the bandwidth\n   requirement in the access point
    is increasing.  Thus it is a general\n   case in the existing operator's network
    that WTPs forward the\n   wireless frames directly to Access Router (AR) to avoid
    overload on\n   the AC.  In this scenario, CAPWAP Control Channel and CAPWAP Data\n
    \  Channel are separated from each other.  This document extends CAPWAP\n   for
    applicability of CAPWAP Control and Data Channel separation.\n\n\n\t "

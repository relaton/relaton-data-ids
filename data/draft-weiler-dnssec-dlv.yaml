  content: "DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) is a mechanism for publishing DNS Security
    (DNSSEC) trust anchors outside of the DNS delegation chain.  It allows validating
    resolvers to validate DNSSEC-signed data from zones whose ancestors either aren't
    signed or don't publish Delegation Signer (DS) records for their children.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

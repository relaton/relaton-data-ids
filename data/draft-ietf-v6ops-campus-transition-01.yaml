  content: "   In this document we consider and analyse the specific scenario of\n
    \  IPv6 transition and deployment in a large department of a university\n   campus
    network.  The department is large enough to operate its own\n   instances of all
    the conventional university services including (for\n   example) web, DNS, email,
    filestore, interactive logins, and remote\n   and wireless access.  The scenario
    is a dual-stack one, i.e.\n   transition to IPv6 means deploying IPv6 in the first
    instance (and\n   probably for some time) alongside IPv4.  This analysis identifies
    the\n   available components for IPv6 transition, while validating the\n   applicability
    of the IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios informational\n   text.  It focuses on
    the network and associated service elements of\n   the transition, rather than
    the application elements.\n\t "

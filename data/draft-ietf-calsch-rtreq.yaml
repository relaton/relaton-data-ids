- language: en

  content: "The purpose of this document is to create a framework for selecting the
    appropriate solution for a real-time protocol designed to allow calendaring and
    scheduling systems from different vendors to interoperate.  To that end, it describes
    the assumptions about the context in which this protocol will operate, and the
    requirements that the protocol must meet.   These requirements are not intended
    to apply to a companion protocol which will use E-mail based transport to achieve
    interoperability.  The E-mail based protocol, which is the subject of a different
    document, will not make any assumptions about transport latency.\n\t "

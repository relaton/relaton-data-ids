  content: "The new multi6 design team as of august 2004 is chartered to explore\nmultihoming
    by means of a \"layer 3.5 wedge\" that allows unmodified\napplications and transport
    protocols to become address agile. \n\nIn order to do this, the two hosts involved
    must communicate certain\nparameters. The exact nature of this communication isn't
    specified at\nthis time. However, this document discusses certain security issues\npertaining
    to such communication. \n\t "

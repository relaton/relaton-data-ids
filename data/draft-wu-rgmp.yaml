  content: "This document describes the Router-port Group Management Protocol (RGMP).
    \ This protocol was developed by Cisco Systems and is used between multicast routers
    and switches to restrict multicast packet forwarding in switches to those routers
    where the packets may be needed.  RGMP is designed for backbone switched networks
    where multiple, high speed routers are interconnected.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

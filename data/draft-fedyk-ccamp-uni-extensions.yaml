  content: "   This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and defines\n
    \  extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route\n   diversity
    within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge\n   nodes. A particular
    example where route diversity within the core\n   network is desired, are dual-homed
    edge nodes. The core network is\n   typically composed of multiple network domains
    and those multi-domain\n   diversity aspects that have an implication on the GMPLS
    UNI\n   extensions are discussed.\n\n   The document also defines GMPLS UNI extensions
    to deal with latency\n   requirements for edge node initiated LSPs.\n\n   This
    document uses a VPN model that is based on the same premise as\n   L1VPN framework
    [RFC4847] but may also be applied to other\n   technologies.  The extensions are
    applicable both to VPN and non VPN\n   environments. These extensions move the
    UNI from basic connectivity\n   to enhanced mode connectivity by including additional
    constraints\n   while minimizing the exchange of CE to PE information. These\n
    \  extensions are applicable to the overlay extension service model.\n   Route
    Diversity for customer LSPs are a common requirement applicable\n   to L1VPNs.
    The UNI mechanisms described in this document are L1VPN\n   compatible and can
    be applied to achieve diversity for sets of\n   customer LSPs.\n\n   The UNI extensions
    in support of latency constraints can also be\n   applied to the extended overlay
    service model in order for the\n   customer LSPs to meet certain latency requirements.\n\n\t "

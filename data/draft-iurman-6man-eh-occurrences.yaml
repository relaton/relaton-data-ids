abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 8200 by specifying normative requirements
    on the number of occurrences of IPv6 Extension Headers. Operational experience
    has demonstrated that permitting multiple occurrences of the same Extension Header
    can create parsing ambiguity, increase attack surface, and complicate packet processing
    in general. This is especially true for both the Hop-by-Hop Options Header and
    the Destination Options Header, which can contain a number of options. This document
    restricts IPv6 packets to carry at most one instance of each Extension Header,
    with the exception of the Destination Options Header, which is permitted to appear
    twice as specified in RFC 8200.</p>"

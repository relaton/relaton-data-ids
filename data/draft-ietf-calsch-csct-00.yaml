  content: "There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring
    and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling and Personal
    Information Management (PIM) products are being extended for use across the Internet,
    today, in proprietary ways. This document has been defined to provide the a definition
    of a MIME message format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information
    across the Internet.     This memo is meant to serve as the basis for registration
    of such a MIME media type per [RFC1521]. The proposed media type value is 'TEXT/CALENDAR'.
    This string would label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information
    encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below.      This MIME
    media type provides a standard content type for capturing calendar event and todo
    information. It also can be used to convey free/busy time information. The content
    type is suitable as a MIME message entity that can be transferred over MIME based
    email systems or using HTTP. In addition, the content type is useful as an object
    for interactions between desktop applications using the operating system clipboard,
    drag/drop or file systems capabilities.\n\t "

  content: "   In this contribution, we present HAWAII: a domain-based approach for\n
    \  supporting mobility.  HAWAII uses specialized path setup schemes\n   which
    install host-based forwarding entries in specific routers to\n   support intra-domain
    micro-mobility and defaults to using Mobile-IP\n   for inter-domain macro-mobility.
    \ These path setup schemes deliver\n   excellent performance by reducing mobility
    related disruption to user\n   applications, and by operating locally, reduce
    the number of mobility\n   related updates.  Also, in HAWAII, mobile hosts retain
    their network\n   address while moving within the domain, simplifying Quality
    of\n   Service support.  Furthermore, reliability is achieved through the\n   use
    of soft-state forwarding entries for the mobile hosts, and the\n   elimination
    of foreign agents and, in some cases, the home agent.\n\n\t "

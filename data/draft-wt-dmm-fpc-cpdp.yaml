  content: "   The specification as per this document supports the separation of the\n
    \  Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the actual\n   Data-Plane.
    \ The protocol semantics abstract from the actual details\n   for the configuration
    of Data-Plane nodes and apply between a Client\n   function, which is used by
    an application of the mobility Control-\n   Plane, and an Agent function, which
    is associated with the\n   configuration of Data-Plane nodes according to the
    policies issued by\n   the mobility Control-Plane.  The scope of the policies
    comprises\n   forwarding rules and treatment of packets in terms of encapsulation,\n
    \  IP address re-writing and QoS.  Additional protocol semantics are\n   described
    to support the maintenance of the Data-Plane path.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) \nmechanism
    for a challenge-based authentication using MD5 in \nconjunction with the hash
    algorithm used to store the password \nwithin an identity store.  \nThis document
    defines the EAP-LDAP method, which provides one-way \nauthentication and MD5 key
    generation. As a result, the EAP-LDAP \nmethod, when used by it self, is only
    appropriate for use on \nnetworks where physical security can be assumed. These
    methods \nSHOULD NOT be used on wireless networks, or over the Internet, \nunless
    the EAP conversation is protected. This can be accomplished \nusing technologies
    such as IPsec or TLS.  \n    \n\t "

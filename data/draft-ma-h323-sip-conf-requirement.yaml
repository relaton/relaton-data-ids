  content: "   H.323 conference system is well defined and widely deployed today.\n
    \  It is important for SIP UA, both IPv4 and IPv6, to access H.323\n   conference
    system.  This document defines an architecture for a SIP\n   UA to access H.323
    conference system.  The requirements for the\n   elements in this architecture
    are examined.  Also the transition\n   scenario for IPv6 SIP UA to access IPv4
    H.323 conference system is\n   discussed.\n\t "

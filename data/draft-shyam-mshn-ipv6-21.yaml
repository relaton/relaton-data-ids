  content: "   This document tries to address an approach for the reorganization of\n
    \  the entire network in a large address space. It describes how a\n   three-tier
    mesh structured hierarchy can be established based on\n   fragmenting the entire
    space into some regions and some sub regions\n   inside each of them. It addresses
    issues which could be relevant to\n   this architecture in the context of IPv6.
    This document also tries to\n   come out with an approach how IP switch based
    network can perform as\n   good as ATM network for the processing of real time
    traffic.\n\n\t "

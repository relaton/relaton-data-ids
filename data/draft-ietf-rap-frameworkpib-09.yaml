  content: "This document defines a set of PRovisioning Classes (PRCs) and textual
    conventions that are common to all clients that provision policy using Common
    Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol for Provisioning.\n\n Structure of Policy
    Provisioning Information (SPPI) describes a structure for specifying policy information
    that can then be transmitted to a network device for the purpose of configuring
    policy at that device. The model underlying this structure is one of well-defined
    (PRCs) and instances of these classes (PRIs) residing in a virtual information
    store called the Policy Information Base (PIB).\n\n One way to provision policy
    is by means of the (COPS) protocol with the extensions for provisioning. This
    protocol supports multiple clients, each of which may provision policy for a specific
    policy domain such as QoS, virtual private networks, or security.\n\n As described
    in COPS usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR), each client supports a non-overlapping
    and independent set of PIB modules. However, some PRovisioning Classes are common
    to all subject-categories (client-types) and need to be present in each.\n\t "

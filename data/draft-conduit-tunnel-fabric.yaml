abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies CONDUIT, a tunnel fabric management protocol
    for tactical and enterprise networks operating over heterogeneous Wide Area Network
    (WAN) links. CONDUIT automates the lifecycle management of IPsec tunnels, monitors
    tunnel health through active probing, and publishes quality metrics to enable
    Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) based traffic engineering. CONDUIT follows a
    strict separation of concerns: it manages the underlay tunnel fabric while delegating
    all traffic engineering decisions to SRv6. This architecture simplifies network
    operations, enables rapid adaptation to changing WAN conditions, and leverages
    standard SRv6 capabilities including Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algo) and Topology-Independent
    Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA). The protocol is fully programmable via gRPC and
    mandates compliance with Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 (CNSA
    2.0) cryptographic requirements.</p>"

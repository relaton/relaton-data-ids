  content: "   This memorandum describes an internetworking architecture of Cell\n
    \  Switch Router (CSR) and related control protocol overview. Cell\n   Switch
    Router is an ATM-based label switching router that can\n   provide ATM cut-through
    paths for packet flows with various levels\n   of granularity while retaining
    current router-based internetworking\n   architecture. The proposed architecture
    is able to provide the\n   cut-through path in response to the creation of IP
    forwarding entry\n   (topology-driven), the arrival of data packets (traffic-driven),\n
    \  and the reception of control packets such as RSVP (request-driven).\n   One
    important feature that is provided by the proposed architecture\n   is interoperability
    with the emerging ATM network platform,\n   specified by the ATM Forum and/or
    ITU-T, which provides PVC\n   (Permanent Virtual Channel), VP (Virtual Path),
    or SVC (Switched\n   Virtual Channel) services.\n\n\t "

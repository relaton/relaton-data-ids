  content: "   This document discusses the issues involved in elevating RTP to the\n
    \  status of protocol, equivalent to TCP or UDP. This will result in all\n   RTP
    packets being explicitly labeled as such in the packet header.\n   This vastly
    simplifies the problem of classifying real time streams.\n   Such classification
    operations are essential for successful deploy-\n   ment of RTP header compression,
    differentiated services, and traffic\n   isolation. We define the format of the
    RTP protocol header, and dis-\n   cuss issues of backwards compatibility.\n\n\t "

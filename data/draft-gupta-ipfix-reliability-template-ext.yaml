  content: "IPFIX[RFC3917] mandates the IPFIX device should be reliable.To be\nreliable
    the individual components like the Metering process or the\nExporting process
    should not fail to meter & export the flow\ninformation to the collector, else
    indicate its incapability\nexplicitly.\n\nCurrently, IPFIX transmits failure by
    sending count of packets,flows\nit failed to process along with the duration of
    the failure.\n\nThis document outlines some of the limitations an IPFIX device
    may\nhave and suggests solutions.\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a PHB (per-hop behavior) called Expedited Forwarding
    (EF).  The PHB is a basic building block in the Differentiated Services architecture.
    \ EF is intended to provide a building block for low delay, low jitter and low
    loss services by ensuring that the EF aggregate is served at a certain configured
    rate.  This document obsoletes RFC 2598. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

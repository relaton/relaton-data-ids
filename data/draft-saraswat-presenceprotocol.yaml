  content: "       The Presence Protocol is designed to maintain presence\n       information
    about a potentially large number of online users\n       connected through various
    Points of Presence (PoPs), and\n       belonging to several Federations (which
    are collections of\n       uniformly administered entities).  The Presence Protocol\n
    \      meets several of the requirements for a Presence Information\n       Protocol
    [PIP-Req] in a simple, direct fashion. (Issues\n       around security of messages
    are deliberately excluded from\n       this draft.)\n \n       The Presence Protocol
    is related to the [PIP-Demo] protocol.\n       It differs from it in introducing
    a notion of Points of\n       Presence, mediating between the Presence Server
    and user\n       agents (clients) and specifys a mechanism for a user to\n       control
    the dissemination of their own presence information.\n       It is substantially
    simpler, doing away with leases (in\n       favor of pings), eliminating redirections,
    and eliminating\n       the dependence on an HTTP-style transport protocol. Further,\n
    \      it leaves for a separate protocol, the Messaging Protocol,\n       the
    task of defining how Instant Messages should be\n       communicated between points
    of presence.\n\n\t "

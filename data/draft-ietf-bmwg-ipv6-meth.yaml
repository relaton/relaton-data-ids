  content: "The benchmarking methodologies defined in RFC 2544 are IP version independent.
    \ However, RFC 2544 does not address some of the specificities of IPv6.  This
    document provides additional benchmarking guidelines, which in conjunction with
    RFC 2544, lead to a more complete and realistic evaluation of the IPv6 performance
    of network interconnect devices.  IPv6 transition mechanisms are outside the scope
    of this document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

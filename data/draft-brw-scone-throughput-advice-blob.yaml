  content: "   Traffic exchanged over a network may be subject to rate-limit\n   policies
    for various operational reasons.  This document specifies a\n   generic object
    (called, Throughput Advice) that can be used by\n   mechanisms for hosts to dynamically
    discover these network rate-limit\n   policies.  This information is then passed
    to applications that might\n   adjust their behaviors accordingly.\n\n   The design
    of the throughput advice object is independent of the\n   discovery channel (protocol,
    API, etc.).\n\n\t "

  content: "A general tunnel establishment protocol (TEP)  is  defined  to  handle\n
    \  multi-protocol  tunneling  as  well  as  multilevel domains guarded by\n   tunnel
    agents which  may  be  thought  of  as  security  gateways,  or\n   alternatively
    \ as  modified  foreign agents defined by with Mobile IP.\n   Mobile IP provides
    the model for TEP; the registration messages in RFC\n   2002 establish a tunnel
    between the home agent and the foreign agent.\n\t "

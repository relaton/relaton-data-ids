  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\nfor
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\nIn particular,
    it describes objects for configuring autonomous report\ngeneration on any device
    that supports MIBs containing counter and\ngauge objects for performance monitoring.
    \ This allows a management\nstation to instruct a device to build off-line reports
    to be\ncollected asynchronously by the management station.\n\t "

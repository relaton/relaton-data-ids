  content: "   Traffic statistics form an important part of operations and\n   maintenance
    data that are used to create demand matrices and for\n   capacity planning in
    networks.  Segment Routing (SR) is a source\n   routing paradigm that uses stack
    of labels to represent a path.  The\n   SR path specific state is not stored in
    any other node in the network\n   except the head-end node of the SR path.  Traffic
    statistics specific\n   to each SR path are an important component of the data
    which helps\n   the controllers to lay out the SR paths in a way that optimizes
    the\n   use of network resources.  SR paths are inherently ECMP aware.\n\n   As
    SR paths do not have state in the core of the network, it is not\n   possible
    to collect the SR path traffic statistics accurately on each\n   interface.  This
    document describes an MPLS forwarding plane\n   mechanism to identify the SR path
    to which a packet belongs and so\n   facilitate accounting of traffic for MPLS
    SR paths.\n\n   The mechanisms described in this document may also be applied
    to\n   other MPLS paths (i.e., Label Switched Paths) and can be used to\n   track
    traffic statistics in multipoint-to-point environments such as\n   those where
    LDP is in use.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo defines a framework for authorization in constrained-node\n
    \  networks, i.e. networks where some devices have severe constraints on\n   memory,
    processing, power and communication bandwidth.  The main goal\n   is to offload
    constrained devices by providing them access control\n   support from trusted
    parties that are less constrained.  The approach\n   is based on RESTful requests
    to dedicated access management\n   resources, supporting different authorization
    schemes and\n   communication security paradigms.\n\n\t "

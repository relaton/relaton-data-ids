  content: "   This draft describes a light weight route optimization technique that\n
    \  helps to optimize the media path between two communicating nodes when\n   Proxy
    MIP is used as the mobility protocol.  This routing\n   optimization technique
    is most useful when the two communicating\n   hosts are away from home and need
    to communicate with each other\n   using an optimized path.  It takes advantage
    of the data packet\n   between LMA and MAG to set up the optimized data path between
    the\n   communicating hosts.  This route optimization technique is applicable\n
    \  to both the intra-LMA and inter-LMA scenarios.\n\t "

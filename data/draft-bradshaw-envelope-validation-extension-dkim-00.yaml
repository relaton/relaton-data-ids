  content: "   DKIM as defined in RFC6376 is an IETF standard of cryptographically\n
    \  signing email with a domain key.  DKIM is widely used to build a\n   reputation
    based on the signing domain and assign that reputation to\n   message filtering.
    \ Section 8.6 defines a vulnerability called DKIM\n   replay, in which a single
    message can be replayed to a large group of\n   unrelated recipients, thereby
    hijacking the reputation of the\n   original sender.  This proposal defines a
    method of declaring the\n   original envelope sender and recipient(s) within a
    DKIM signature\n   such that compliant DKIM validators can detect a DKIM signature
    which\n   may have been replayed and modify their use of domain reputation\n   accordingly.
    \ This technique remains fully backwards compatible with\n   DKIM validators which
    do not support the new methods, while allowing\n   compliant forwarders to declare
    their ingress authentication state in\n   Authentication Results headers for consumption
    by subsequent\n   validators.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs. The terminology
    used in by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and by operators of DNS
    systems, has sometimes changed in the decades since the DNS was first defined.
    This document gives current definitions for many of the terms used in the DNS
    in a single document.</p>"

  content: "   JMAP (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile friendly and scalable\n
    \  protocol that can be used for data of any type.  This makes it a good\n   fit
    for migrations or data portability use cases.  However, due to\n   its large set
    of features, it is also quite complex, which makes it\n   difficult to explore
    new application domains in practice.  The goal\n   of this document is to provide
    guidelines on implementing essential\n   parts of JMAP for a much lower entry
    barrier and more efficient\n   implementation of the protocol.\n\n\t "

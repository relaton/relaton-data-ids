  script: Latn
  content: "   The Path Computation Element (PCE) has become established as a core\n
    \  component of Software Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can\n   compute
    optimal paths for traffic across a network for any definition\n   of \"optimal\"
    and can also monitor changes in resource availability\n   and traffic demands
    to update the paths.\n\n   Conventionally, the PCE has been used to derive paths
    for MPLS Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs).  These paths are supplied using the
    Path\n   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) to the head end of\n
    \  the LSP for signaling in the MPLS network.\n\n   SDN has a far broader applicability
    than just signaled MPLS traffic\n   engineered networks, and the PCE may be used
    to determine paths in a\n   wide range of use cases including static LSPs, segment
    routing,\n   service function chaining (SFC), and indeed any form of routed or\n
    \  switched network.  It is, therefore reasonable to consider PCEP as a\n   general
    southbound control protocol for use in these environments to\n   allow the PCE
    to be fully enabled as a central controller.\n\n   This document briefly introduces
    the architecture for PCE as a\n   central controller, examines the motivations
    and applicability for\n   PCEP as a southbound interface, and introduces the implications
    for\n   the protocol.  This document does not describe the use cases in\n   detail
    and does not define protocol extensions: that work is left for\n   other documents.\n\n\t "

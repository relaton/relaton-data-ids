  content: "   A mobile network can be multihomed as described in [RFC4980].  This\n
    \  document describes the experimental result of service differentiation\n   using
    multihoming with multiple prefixes.  The multiple prefixes in\n   IPv6 NEMO implements
    multiple virtual mobile networks on a single\n   physical NEMO.  The multiple
    virtual mobile networks provide service\n   differentiation on a single mobile
    network.  Each mobile network node\n   inside the mobile network prioritizes for
    service differenciation.\n   It can be differenciated among the virutal mobile
    networks or\n   forwarding traffic from each virtual mobile network to different\n
    \  access networks.  In this experiment, a mobile router with multiple\n   interfaces
    can make connection to several access networks\n   simultaneoulsly.\n\n\t "

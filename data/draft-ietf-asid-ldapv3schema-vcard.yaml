  content: "The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAPV3] is gaining widespread
    acceptance as a method for accessing Internet directories.  Many of the LDAP clients
    accessing these directories also provide support for emitting the directory information
    in the form of a vCard electronic business card object. This memo defines a new
    X.500 object class, called the vCardObject, that extends the X.521 standard organizationalPerson
    and residentialPerson in order to provide a unique LDAP schema for accessing  Internet
    directories in terms of the vCard attributes.                     The schema defined
    by this memo should be used when accessing a directory via LDAP Version 3 and
    searching or retrieving directory information based on vCard related attributes.
    The schema describes the attribute types and object classes that have a 1-to-one
    correspondence with vCard properties.  This schema may also be used to define
    a set of object classes and attributes for storing metadata and binding information
    for a directory entry that closely follows the vCard object in directories that
    support LDAP.\n\t "

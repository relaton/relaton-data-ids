  content: "   This specification provides a way for an ephemeral or transactional\n
    \  OAuth 2.0 client to signal to the AS that the client does not need or\n   expect
    to have an identified state outside the existence of any\n   issued access and
    refresh tokens.  The specification also enables a\n   client to push its registration
    information to the AS during a pushed\n   authorization request.\n\n\t "

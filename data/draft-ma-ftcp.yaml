- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Being the widely used transport protocol in Internet, TCP might be \ninfluenced
    by the congestion occurred in those nodes (i.e., routers, \nIP/ATM access nodes,
    and ATM switches) along the travelling path. Since \nTCP relies on the end-to-end
    window-based mechanism to explain the \ncongestion, there is limited room for
    intermediate network elements to \nexplicitly contribute to the TCP control. However,
    in huge pipe \nnetworks, TCP might be ineffective because it starts decreasing
    its rate \njust after it senses packet's loss, implying that the network has \nalready
    been congested somewhere. A general mechanism of delaying ACKs \nin congested
    nodes is presented in this draft to connect the traffic \ncontrol of TCP with
    that of network elements. This mechanism can be \nconsidered as an enhancement
    to the currently prevalent TCP and referred \nto Fast-TCP. The basic idea of Fast-TCP
    arises from the fact that \ncontrolling ACK flows can indirectly affect the dynamics
    of TCP's \nbehavior. ACK delay mechanism can be easily implemented in various
    \nnetwork nodes where information of link utilization or buffer occupancy \nmay
    be employed to notify the congestion. By using ACK delay policy at \nIP routers
    in a complex network, we present the simulation results to \nshow that this policy
    achieves good TCP throughput and reduces the \nbuffer requirement.\n\t "

  content: "The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain\ncomputational
    and communication overhead with respect to the number\nof round-trips required
    and the cryptographic operations involved.\nIn remote access situations, the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol\n(EAP) is used for authentication, which adds several
    more round trips\nand consequently latency.\n\nTo re-establish security associations
    (SA) upon a failure recovery\ncondition is time consuming, especially when an
    IPsec peer, such as a\nVPN gateway, needs to re-establish a large number of SAs
    with various\nend points.  A high number of concurrent sessions might cause\nadditional
    problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment.\n\nIn order to avoid the
    need to re-run the key exchange protocol from\nscratch it would be useful to provide
    an efficient way to resume an\nIKE/IPsec session.  This document proposes an extension
    to IKEv2 that\nallows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly\nefficient
    manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.\n\nA client can reconnect to
    a gateway from which it was disconnected.\nThe proposed approach uses a ticket
    to store state information that\nis later made available to the IKEv2 responder
    for re-authentication.\nRestoring state information by utilizing a ticket is one
    possible\nway.  This document does not specify the format of the ticket but\nrecommendations
    are provided.\n\t "

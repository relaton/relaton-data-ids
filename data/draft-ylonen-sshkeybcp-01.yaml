  content: "   This document presents current recommended practice for managing SSH\n
    \  user keys for automated access.  It provides guidelines for\n   discovering,
    remediating, and continuously managing SSH user keys and\n   other authentication
    credentials.\n\n   Various threats from poorly managed SSH keys are identified,\n
    \  including virus spread, unaudited backdoors, illegitimate access\n   using
    leaked keys, lack of proper termination of access, use of\n   legitimate access
    for unintended purposes, and accidental human\n   errors.\n\n   Hundreds of thousands,
    even over a million SSH keys authorizing\n   access have been found from the IT
    environments of many large\n   organizations.  This is many times more than they
    have interactive\n   users.  These access-granting credentials have largely been
    ignored\n   in identity and access management, and present a real risk to\n   information
    security.\n\n   A process is presented for discovering who has access to what,\n
    \  bringing an existing IT environment under control with respect to\n   automated
    access and SSH keys.  The process includes moving\n   authorized keys to protected
    locations, removing unused keys,\n   associating authorized keys with a business
    process or application\n   and removing keys for which no valid purpose can be
    found, rotating\n   existing keys, restricting what can be done with each authorized
    key,\n   and establishing an approval process for new authorized keys.  A\n   process
    is also presented for continuous monitoring and controlled\n   authorized key
    setup.\n\n   Finally, recommendations are made for security policy makers for\n
    \  ensuring that automated access and SSH keys are properly addressed in\n   an
    organization's security policy.\n\n   Specific requirements are presented that
    address the security issues\n   while keeping costs reasonable.\n\n   Guidance
    is also provided on how to reduce operational cost while\n   addressing the threats
    and how to use tools to automate the\n   management process.\n\n\t "

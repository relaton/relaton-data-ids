  content: "   This document aims at discussing some research issues about the\n   implementation
    of information-centric network (ICN) architectures.\n   Towards this end, we first
    review the implementation methods employed\n   by various ICNs and discuss the
    potential problems of these\n   implementations.  Then we propose a unified framework
    for ICN\n   implementation based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique\n
    \  which can facilitate the implementation of any ICN architecture and\n   interoperability
    among different ICN architectures.\n\n\t "

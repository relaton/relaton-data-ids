  content: "The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) specification
    defines a generic Distance Vector protocol that is adapted to a variety of network
    types by the application of specific Objective Functions (OFs). An OF states the
    outcome of the process used by a RPL node to select and optimize routes within
    a RPL Instance based on the Information Objects available; an OF is not an algorithm.\n\n
    This document specifies a basic Objective Function that relies only on the objects
    that are defined in the RPL and does not use any protocol extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

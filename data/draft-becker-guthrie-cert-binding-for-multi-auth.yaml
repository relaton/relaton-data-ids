abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a new CSR attribute, relatedCertRequest, and
    a\n   new X.509 certificate extension, RelatedCertificate.  The use of the\n   relatedCertRequest
    attribute in a CSR and the inclusion of the\n   RelatedCertificate extension in
    the resulting certificate together\n   provide additional assurance that two certificates
    each belong to the\n   same end entity.  This mechanism is particularly useful
    in the\n   context of non-composite hybrid authentication, which enables users\n
    \  to employ the same certificates in hybrid authentication as in\n   authentication
    done with only traditional or post-quantum algorithms.\n\n\t "

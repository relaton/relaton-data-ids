  content: "   This document specifies an attribute for attestation to the\n   possession
    of a private key.  As part of X.509 certificate\n   enrollment, a Certification
    Authority (CA) typically demands proof\n   that the subject has possession of
    the private key that corresponds\n   to the to-be-certified public key.  In some
    cases, CAs might accept\n   an attestation from the subject.  For example, when
    a subject needs\n   separate certificates for a signature and key establishment,
    an\n   attestation that can be validated with the previously issued\n   signature
    certificate might be adequate for subsequent issuance of\n   the key establishment
    certificate.\n\n\t "

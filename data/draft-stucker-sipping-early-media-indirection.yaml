  content: "   This document describes models that can be used to manage multiple\n
    \  early media streams in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The\n   model
    seeks to allow calling party endpoints to be able to better\n   control the rendering
    of early media to the user, and distinguish\n   early media from final media.\n\n
    \  Although some of early media challenges are likely to never be\n   overcome,
    (e.g. when interworking with an ISUP PSTN gateway that does\n   not take into
    account CPG or ACM messages), the potential to improve\n   on what is already
    there does exist.  The recommendations in this\n   document are intended to be
    an update to RFC-3960 recommendations and\n   to avoid many of the complications
    outlined in\n   draft-stucker-sipping-early-media-coping.\n\n\n\t "

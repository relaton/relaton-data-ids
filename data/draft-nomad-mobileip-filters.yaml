  content: "Filters for Mobile IPv4 bindings enables mobile nodes to associate \none
    or more Filters with mobility bindings during registration. \nFlows that match
    a Filter will be processed as defined by the \nFilter. In this manner, it is possible
    for a mobile node to \ndistribute flows or packets of a flow among its available
    points of \nattachment, or to request that such flows are dropped before \nreaching
    the mobile node.\n\t "

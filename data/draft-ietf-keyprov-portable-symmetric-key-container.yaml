  content: "This document specifies a symmetric key format for transport and\n   provisioning
    of symmetric keys (for example One Time Password (OTP)\n   shared secrets or symmetric
    cryptographic keys) to different types of\n   crypto modules such as a strong
    authentication device.  The standard\n   key transport format enables enterprises
    to deploy best-of-breed\n   solutions combining components from different vendors
    into the same\n   infrastructure.\n\n   This work is based on earlier work by
    the members of OATH (Initiative\n   for Open AuTHentication) to specify a format
    that can be freely\n   distributed to the technical community.  The authors believe
    that a\n   common and shared specification will facilitate adoption of two-\n
    \  factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability\n   between
    commercial and open-source implementations.\n\t "

  content: "The International Telecommunications Union Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
    has created the H.350 series of Recommendations that specify directory services
    architectures in support of multimedia conferencing protocols.  The goal of the
    architecture is to 'directory enable' multimedia conferencing so that these services
    can leverage existing identity management and enterprise directories.  A particular
    goal is to enable an enterprise or service provider to maintain a canonical source
    of users and their multimedia conferencing systems, so that multiple call servers
    from multiple vendors, supporting multiple protocols, can all access the same
    data store.  Because SIP is an IETF standard, the contents of H.350 and H.350.4
    are made available via this document to the IETF community.  This document contains
    the entire normative text of ITU-T Recommendations H.350 and H.350.4 in sections
    4 and 5, respectively.  The remaining sections are included only in this document,
    not in the ITU-T version.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

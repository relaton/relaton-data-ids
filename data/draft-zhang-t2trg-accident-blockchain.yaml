  content: "   Blockchain is a distributed technology, and it uses cryptography and\n
    \  hash functions to store data in a chain to ensure that data are\n   tamper-resistant
    and traceable.  So, this document proposes an\n   architecture for collecting
    traffic accident information based on\n   blockchain.  At the same time, this
    document describes the working\n   method of collecting traffic accident information
    under this\n   architecture.\n\n\t "
